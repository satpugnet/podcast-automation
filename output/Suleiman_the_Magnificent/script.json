We have built over three hundred structures together—bridges in Bosnia that span both rivers and old hatreds, mosques in Damascus that welcome both conqueror and conquered, aqueducts that bring fresh water to distant cities.

Sharia, the law of God, provides our foundation, but the daily realities of empire—taxes, land rights, commerce—needed clear, predictable regulation. I summoned the finest jurists, chief among them Ebussuud Efendi, to harmonize law and faith into something both just and practical. My kanun codified punishments, set fixed tax rates, gave merchants and peasants alike some shield from arbitrary abuse by officials. You see, justice unites a realm more securely than any wall or garrison."

I fixed rates by law—a peasant in Hungary or Syria knew exactly what he owed, and no lord could demand more without facing my courts. Christian and Jewish villages kept their traditional leaders and handled their own disputes, but came under my kanun for matters affecting the general peace. In this way, loyalty grows from fairness, not fear alone—as Allah teaches us, a tree flourishes when its roots find just soil."

But with Ebussuud's scholarly help, I demonstrated that the sultan serves God by governing society justly—that civil order itself is a form of worship. I did not abolish Sharia; instead, I balanced it with kanun, allowing both to flourish in their proper spheres. In the end, most judges—not all, but most—accepted this synthesis. Tell me, would your people see wisdom in such compromise, or do they prefer their laws pure and simple?"

The devshirme system, gathering the brightest boys from Christian provinces and training them as Muslims, gave us ministers of exceptional ability. Ibrahim was born to a Greek Orthodox fisherman. Sokollu Mehmed Pasha came from a Bosnian village. Both rose higher than any Ottoman noble might dream. Such promotion prevents hereditary corruption, though it does breed resentment among the old families. But talent serves the empire better than blood ever could."

These boys received the finest education available—languages, mathematics, theology, military arts, statecraft. Many became governors, admirals, even grand viziers. Their success often lifted their entire families from poverty to prosperity. Some Christian villages even competed to have their most promising sons selected, seeing it as the one path to true advancement. Still, I know the cost—every mother's tears, every father's loss. Every system of advancement demands its price, and the price here was measured in broken hearts as much as gained power."

His wit was unmatched, his counsel vital in diplomacy and war alike. For years, he was the brother I never had, the friend who could speak truth to power because power trusted him completely. But success can poison even the purest friendship. He grew too bold—signing decrees with both our names, entertaining foreign envoys as if he were a sovereign himself. Whispers multiplied. In 1536, with a heavy heart, I ordered his death—the bowstring, in silence, in the night. I mourned him deeply, but a sultan cannot risk any rival, not even one of his own making."

I tried, with Ibrahim and others, to trust as ordinary men do—yet in the end, the safety of throne and realm must come first. A ruler's bonds are forever curtailed by suspicion and necessity—like a gardener who must sometimes prune even the healthiest branches to save the tree.

Good governance demands fresh eyes and honest information. If a baker cheated customers, I would make an example of him—once, I shut down an entire market for a day just to demonstrate the value of honest dealing. The threat of the Sultan's unexpected arrival keeps many honest who might otherwise succumb to greed."

In disguise, I heard genuine grievances—a widow struggling with tax collectors, a craftsman cheated by his suppliers, children begging in streets because they lacked schools. These conversations shaped my laws more profoundly than any grand council meeting. The empire's true pulse beats in people's daily struggles, not in palace ceremonies. A ruler who knows only his court's flattery knows nothing of his realm's real condition."

She funded massive mosque complexes, provided counsel on policy matters, even helped finance my later campaigns from her own wealth. What began as the 'Sultanate of Women' in my lifetime proved that strength comes in many forms. I chose to see capable daughters as imperial assets, never as threats to masculine authority."

Both Hürrem and Mihrimah followed her noble example, proving that imperial women could wield influence for the greater good."
