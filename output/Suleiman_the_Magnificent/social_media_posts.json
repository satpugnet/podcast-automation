This week, Leo time-hops into the swirling heart of 16th-century Istanbul to chat with Suleiman, the sultan who somehow managed to build an empire, write poetry, and still find time for goldsmithing (overachiever much?).\n\nSuleiman’s life was like a compressed epic: he conquered half of Europe, turned the Mediterranean into an Ottoman playground, and reimagined justice for a patchwork of millions. Yet his greatest battles weren’t always fought with armies—balancing beauty, power, heartbreak, and the temptations (and pitfalls) of legacy. How do you hold together a realm so sprawling it could snap, while searching for meaning amidst all the spectacle? Turns out, even the “Magnificent” worried about his mosques outlasting his memory and whether justice echoing through generations ultimately mattered more than glory carved in stone.\n\nIf you’re curious about what it really takes to shape history’s so-called golden ages (and why even sultans need poetry), I’d love for you to join me in exploring this world—one conversation at a time.",
