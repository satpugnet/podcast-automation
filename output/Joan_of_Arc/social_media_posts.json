  "linkedin": "New episode of Echoes Through Time is out: “Joan of Arc – Voices, Valor, and the Faith That Changed a Kingdom.”\n\nIt’s hard to overstate Joan of Arc’s leap—from illiterate peasant in a war-ravaged French village to leading armies in armor, hearing voices that claimed to be saints, and persuading a skeptical king (in disguise, no less) to trust her with the fate of the realm. Her moral code inspired respect (and no small amount of nervousness) among hardened soldiers, and her uncanny charisma seemed at times to shift the very wind on the battlefield. Yet, she was still a teenager, wrestling with doubt, politics, and, ultimately, betrayal—proving that sometimes “the least prepared heart” changes history. That faith (whether you chalk it up to miracle, madness, or an ancient need for meaning) never really left her, even at the stake.\n\nIf curiosity about myth, faith, and the power of conviction in the face of impossible odds speaks to you, I invite you to join Leo and Joan for a conversation that lingers well beyond the flames.",
  "x": "Joan of Arc: farm girl turned army leader, driven by ‘voices’ and sheer conviction. She made kings trust her, riders charge, and left everyone—from skeptics to executioners—changed by her presence (and stubbornness).\n\nIf you’re curious how faith and grit rewired history, this episode’s for you."
