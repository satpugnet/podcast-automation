Rumors whisper of a peasant girl—illiterate, unwavering—claiming to bear messages from heaven. With courage audacious as her white armor, she steps into battle, banner raised, destined to lead an army, and, somehow, to change the fate of a nation. Today, we travel to the soul of the Hundred Years’ War to meet the renowned Maid of Orléans. Centuries may lie between us—but Joan of Arc’s legend is as alive and debated as ever."

Inside a simple home, the scent of rye bread and woodsmoke hangs amid devotional icons glittering in the firelight. At the table sits a young woman—barely seventeen—her face illuminated by the hearth and the flame of conviction. Outside, the distant sound of armorers sharpening blades betrays that war is never far. Leo, nearly breathless with both nerves and excitement, prepares to meet Joan of Arc at the very dawn of her myth."

My voices pointed him out to me, and I walked straight forward—choosing him without hesitation. The shock on his face! In private, I told him a secret prayer he had uttered, one known only to God.

I led by my presence, not blade: holding my banner high. In each skirmish, my courage urged them on. Yes, once, an arrow lodged in my shoulder—I pulled it free, prayed, and returned to battle. The city’s bells rang out for days when Orléans was freed."
