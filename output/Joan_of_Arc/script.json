Rumors whisper of a peasant girl—illiterate, unwavering—claiming to bear messages from heaven. With courage audacious as her white armor, she steps into battle, banner raised, destined to lead an army, and, somehow, to change the fate of a nation. Today, we travel to the soul of the Hundred Years’ War to meet the renowned Maid of Orléans.",
