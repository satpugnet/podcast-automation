His empire would stretch wider than Rome's; his name would inspire awe, and for some, dread, for centuries. Yet behind every legend, there is a human being - with hopes, fears, and dreams. Today, our young and ever-curious traveler, Leo, is about to meet the man called 'Chinggis Khaan' by his people - the Universal Ruler. Why did Temüjin become Genghis? What was lost - and what, perhaps, was saved? Step into the untamed grasslands of 13th century Mongolia and prepare for an encounter where myth meets the soul of the steppe itself."
