  "linkedin": "New episode of Echoes Through Time is out: 'Genghis Khan – From Outcast Nomad to Ruler of Empires, Unraveling the Man Behind the Myth.'\n\nThis time, Leo (our somewhat over-caffeinated time traveler) drops into a windswept Mongol war camp to meet Temüjin—better known to history as Genghis Khan. Born an outcast, Genghis rises from near-starvation and family feuds to unify the Mongolian tribes, inventing a kind of meritocracy along the way. His leadership style: reward talent (even if yesterday’s enemy shot your horse), break traditions, and bind men together by law and loyalty rather than blood. Of course, his conquests also left a staggering human cost: whole cities erased, traditions upended, and a legacy stretching from the genetic to the philosophical (no big deal—just one in 200 men today may be his descendant).\n\nIf you’re curious how someone becomes both storm and shelter—a destroyer, lawgiver, and the architect of global networks—this is an episode that got me thinking about how innovation really thrives (and where the limits of ruthlessness lie). Would love for you to give it a listen and share what you take away from meeting the man behind the Mongol myth.",
  "x": "New Echoes Through Time: Leo interviews Genghis Khan. From starving exile to world ruler—he broke traditions, smashed city walls, and launched a meritocracy (often at swordpoint). Imagine inspiring both fear and loyalty across continents.\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered how a legend gets made—and at what cost—this conversation’s worth a listen."
