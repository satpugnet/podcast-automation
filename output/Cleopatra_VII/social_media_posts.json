  "linkedin": "A new episode of Echoes Through Time is out: Cleopatra VII - The Woman Behind the Crown.\n\nCleopatra VII was no myth in gold eyeliner—she was a strategist, linguist, scholar, and a survivor in a world stacked (almost comically) against her. She became Pharaoh at 18, ruled Egypt through famine and intrigue, debated philosophers in the palace garden, and led a navy at Actium. She fought for her throne (and her life) with a blend of intellect and audacity—think more chess grandmaster than Hollywood siren. Even her end was an act of agency, not legend.\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered what the real Cleopatra sounded like—her fears, ambitions, and the weight of legacy—this conversation is for you. I invite you to listen in, and maybe catch a glimpse of the human behind the legend.",
  "x": "New Echoes Through Time: Cleopatra VII. She spoke 9 languages, ruled through chaos, lost the world’s greatest library, and redefined what it meant to lead (while Roman poets gossiped about her eyeliner).\n\nIf you’re curious what history’s last Pharaoh was really like, come join me."
