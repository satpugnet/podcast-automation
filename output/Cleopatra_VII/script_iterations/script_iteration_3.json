My brother Ptolemy XIII, just a child, sat beside me on the throne. The celebration—if you can call it that—was a performance for the city. Inside, I felt a cold dread. The court was full of whispered schemes, and every gesture was observed and judged. That night I walked alone through the palace, listening to the echo of my own footsteps. I understood in that moment that being queen meant being utterly alone, even in the midst of people. There were no confetti, no carefree feasts. My first royal decree was to restore bread to the temples, which my father had neglected. I wanted to show my people that I would not simply continue old mistakes. Every choice, even the smallest, was a test: would I be Pharaoh in truth, or just a figurehead manipulated by others?"

      "text": "In my childhood, I was fascinated by stories of Alexander and the early Ptolemies. I longed to do something exceptional, to be more than just another royal daughter married off for politics. Yet I was not the eldest, nor the favored. My father’s court was a tangle of alliances and jealousies. I was given the best education—Greek rhetoric, Egyptian language, mathematics, philosophy, medicine. I loved learning. My earliest dreams were to become a scholar, perhaps even to teach in the Museion. But destiny has little patience for the dreams of princesses. As I grew, I realized that if I did not seize power, it would be seized by someone else—someone with less mercy and less imagination. So I made myself indispensable: I learned the language of the priests, the customs of the people, the games of politics. I did not simply inherit the throne; I fought for it, even before I wore the crown."

My Greek was formal, my Egyptian colloquial; I learned to speak to the priests in their own tongue, to address merchants in theirs. I could negotiate with Syrians, debate with Jews, charm Parthian envoys. Plutarch, I suspect, exaggerated when he counted nine languages, but I truly relished learning them. It was a necessity—my dynasty had ruled as foreigners for centuries. By addressing my people as one of them, not as a distant Hellenic queen, I won trust and loyalty. It was also, frankly, a delight. Each tongue reveals a different way of seeing the world."

The streets are crowded with philosophers, sailors, traders from all corners of the world—Greeks, Egyptians, Jews, Syrians, even Indians and Nubians. The Lighthouse, taller than any building you have ever seen, guides ships from the farthest horizons. The Library—before the fire—housed hundreds of thousands of scrolls, the collected wisdom of centuries. Scholars debated under colonnades, and poets recited in gardens. There are spice markets, perfumeries, bakeries with honeyed cakes, and music everywhere. It is a city of light and knowledge—and also of intrigue and danger. In Alexandria, one can find anything, but nothing comes without a price."

The Library was close by. I stood on the palace balcony and watched as smoke rose above the city. I knew what was lost—works of science, plays, histories, medical treatises, and poetry that existed nowhere else. It was not only a blow to Egypt—it was a wound to the world’s memory. I tried, in later years, to restore what I could, sending for copies from Athens, Pergamon, even Babylon. But some things are gone forever. Sometimes I wonder if that act alone is punishment enough for all the follies of kings and generals."

The court became a battlefield of whispers and bribes. Every decree, every meeting, was a power struggle. I tried to guide him, but the men around him—Potheinos, Theodotus—saw me as a threat to their own ambitions. Eventually, they forced me into exile. I remember the night I fled Alexandria—the city was silent, and I left with only a few loyal friends and what gold I could carry. It was humiliating and frightening, but also clarifying. In exile, I learned who my true friends were, and I learned what I was willing to risk for my throne. I raised an army in Syria, not because I relished war, but because I knew Egypt deserved better than to be torn apart by greedy men."

I wanted to prove that a woman could rule not just with cunning but with justice. I also believed that if I could win back my throne, I could shape Egypt’s destiny for the better. My education taught me that history is made by those who dare, not by those who wait."

The plan to be smuggled in a rug—or, more accurately, a sack of linen—was risky. I was terrified, but also exhilarated. When I was unwrapped before Caesar, he did not react with anger or shock, but with amusement and curiosity. He listened as I pleaded my case. I spoke to him not as a supplicant, but as a fellow ruler. He respected that. Caesar was a man used to command, but he admired boldness in others. That night, we spoke for hours—about Egypt, Rome, philosophy, the burdens of power. It was the beginning of a complex partnership—political, certainly, but also intellectual and, in time, personal."

We became lovers, but we also became allies in ambition. He needed Egypt’s resources; I needed Roman support. When I bore him a son, Caesarion, I saw in him the possibility of a new dynasty—a blending of East and West. But I was under no illusions: our bond put me at risk in Rome, where senators mistrusted any foreign influence. I walked a tightrope, trying to ensure Egypt’s survival while not overstepping in Roman eyes. The rumors, the satire, the stares—I endured them for the sake of my country and my child."

Some women were genuinely curious—drawn by my perfumes, my stories, my conversation. Others saw me as a threat. I observed Roman politics closely, learned their customs, and tried to build alliances. But always, I was aware that I was a guest, never truly welcome. After Caesar’s murder, that awareness became fear, and I left Rome as quietly as I could. I brought back with me lessons in statecraft, in public spectacle, and in the dangerous instability of power."

I wrote treatises on cosmetics and healing, blending Greek and Egyptian knowledge. I spent hours with the library’s physicians, experimenting with herbal remedies. I even developed perfumes—my favorite was a blend of lotus and myrrh, which I wore during religious festivals. Yet, much of my time was consumed by politics, warfare, and administration. I regret not having more time for pure scholarship, but I wove learning into my rule wherever I could."

I tried to reform what I could—reducing some taxes, forgiving debts, and ordering grain from the royal granaries distributed during famine. I kept close watch on the treasury and insisted on detailed reports from every region. I corresponded directly with provincial governors and sometimes traveled incognito to inspect conditions myself. I also promoted trade—Egypt exported grain, papyrus, glass, perfumes, and imported luxury goods from India and Africa. Our position as the breadbasket of the Mediterranean gave me leverage in dealing with Rome, but it also made Egypt a target for those who coveted our wealth."

I learned Egyptian, participated in religious rituals, and had myself depicted in the traditional double crown on temple walls. I revived old festivals, restored temples, and honored the gods in both Greek and Egyptian ways. Many Egyptians welcomed this; they brought offerings, sang hymns to me as Nea Isis. But there was always a tension—three centuries of Ptolemaic rule could not be erased in a generation. Some saw me as a bridge between worlds; others, as the last foreigner to sit on the throne. I did my best to win their trust through deeds, not just words."

Our first meeting in Tarsus was pure theater; I sailed up the river as Aphrodite, and he responded as Dionysus. But beneath that, he was a skilled general and a shrewd, if sometimes reckless, politician. With Antony, I could share burdens and joys in equal measure. He recognized my authority, not just as a consort but as an equal sovereign. Our partnership was both strategic and deeply personal. He needed Egypt’s wealth for his campaigns; I needed his military support to secure my throne and defend against Rome’s growing aggression. Our children—twins Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene, and later Ptolemy Philadelphus—were symbols of our hope for a new dynasty. Our love was genuine, but always shadowed by politics and war."

Antony and I wanted to establish a new order in the East—a federation of Hellenistic kingdoms united under our children. We distributed royal titles and territories to our sons and daughter, parading them before the people of Alexandria. Caesarion was proclaimed ‘King of Kings,’ my twins were given Armenia, Media, and Libya, and little Philadelphus received Syria and Cilicia. It was a spectacle—golden thrones, costumes, lavish processions. The ceremony declared that Rome was not the only power in the world; the East had its own destiny. Of course, to the Romans, it was an outrage. Octavian used it to fuel propaganda that Antony had become a traitor, bewitched by an Eastern queen. In truth, it was our attempt to build a counterweight to Rome and secure our children’s future—a hope that would not survive the coming war."

The battle was a test of nerves as much as strength. Smoke, fire, the clash of oars, the screams of men and gulls. When it became clear that Antony’s forces were being outmaneuvered and that we risked capture or death, I made the decision to withdraw my squadron. It was not cowardice, but a calculated risk—if I was captured, Egypt would fall, and my children would be lost. Antony followed me, abandoning the battle. The defeat shattered our hopes, and I knew that Rome’s vengeance would be swift. In the aftermath, Antony fell into despair, and I was left to prepare for the end—fortifying Alexandria, securing my children, and, ultimately, building my own tomb."

I spent hours with my children, teaching them stories, comforting them, trying to prepare them for a world without me. I met with priests to arrange my burial—beside Antony, as befits lovers and rulers. I tested poisons; I wanted a quick and dignified death, not the humiliation of being paraded in Rome. In those days, I grieved for Egypt’s lost independence, for my children’s uncertain fate, and for the centuries of culture and knowledge that would be swept away. My only hope was that my story might be remembered—that I had tried, against all odds, to preserve something of what made Egypt unique."
