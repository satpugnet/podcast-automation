My mother, Susannah, was part of the Wedgwood family—famed for their pottery, you know. She passed away when I was only eight, which cast a certain gloom over my early years. Nevertheless, I recall my childhood being filled with curiosity. I collected insects, shells, minerals—anything that caught my eye. I wasn’t too fond of the classical curriculum at Shrewsbury School, but rummaging around the countryside was pure joy."

However, I was deeply unsettled by surgeries performed without anesthesia, which was customary then. I found I couldn’t bear it—the screams, the blood, the horror. I began neglecting medical studies, drifting toward zoology and geology lectures instead. I learned taxidermy from John Edmonstone, a freed slave—a remarkable teacher who shared stories of the tropics, further fueling my sense of adventure. Ultimately, I left Edinburgh without completing that medical track. My father, exasperated, turned me toward the idea of becoming an Anglican clergyman if medicine wouldn’t suit me."

Cambridge was where I became enthralled with natural philosophy. Reverend John Stevens Henslow, the botanist, took me under his wing. We’d have long walks discussing geology, botany, the intricacies of creation. My passion for collecting beetles exploded. I joined eccentric clubs—like the so-called ‘Glutton Club,’ in which friends and I tried exotic animals for dinner. We once ate an old brown owl, which was… not exactly pleasant. Still, Cambridge shaped me profoundly, forging friendships and intellectual expansions that set the stage for what followed."

Our route took us to South America, the Galápagos, across the Pacific, to Australia, around the Indian Ocean, and back. On land, I explored mountains, forests, deserts—collecting plants, fossils, and animals. I was a tireless observer, scribbling endless notes about geology, local peoples, flora, fauna, everything. These observations would later serve as the bedrock for my most significant hypotheses."

I thought it peculiar but didn’t grasp the full significance until I returned to England and analyzed everything with the help of experts like John Gould, who noted that my multiple “species” of birds were all Galápagos finches. It dawned on me that these finches, separated by island environments, had diverged from a common stock. That concept—species mutating over time—began stirring in my mind. But it took years before I fully articulated natural selection as the mechanism."

The epiphanies came in hindsight. Fossils of giant extinct mammals in South America that resembled smaller living species, the earthquake in Chile that raised coastal land, the distribution of organisms on different continents—these pieces aggregated in my notebooks, but not in a refined theory. When I returned in 1836, I began systematically cataloging everything, sending specimens to specialists. The correspondences and analysis that followed clarified the patterns. Coupled with reading Charles Lyell’s Principles of Geology and eventually Malthus’s Essay on Population, I found the conceptual scaffolding that led me to natural selection."

During the voyage, I carried notebooks everywhere, jotting down measurements, sketches, local anecdotes. Back in England, I began what I called my ‘Transmutation Notebooks.’ Every snippet—like variations in breeding or morphological differences between island species—went into them. I also systematically interviewed pigeon breeders, horticulturalists, farmers. They had practical insights into how selective breeding could exaggerate traits. All those puzzle pieces formed the basis of my understanding that nature could similarly favor certain traits in the wild over many generations. Without that thoroughness, I might’ve remained stuck in vague speculation."

I remember confiding in my friend Joseph Hooker that revealing such a view felt like ‘confessing a murder.’ The prevalent belief was that each species was a unique, unchanging creation. To suggest otherwise to devout Victorians—particularly that humans and animals share a common ancestry—seemed near-blasphemous. So I kept refining my evidence quietly, wanting to be absolutely certain before going public."

I studied barnacles, wrote on coral reefs, published on volcanic islands—all to bolster my credibility and to gather a robust bedrock of facts. Only in 1858, when Alfred Russel Wallace sent me an essay outlining the very same principle of natural selection, did I realize the moment had arrived. A joint paper was read at the Linnean Society, then I rushed to condense my decades of work into On the Origin of Species, published in 1859. And indeed, the controversy began almost immediately."

After calming down, I also felt validation: here was another naturalist, independently concluding the same mechanism. He’d been working in the Malay Archipelago with fewer resources, yet arrived at a matching insight. It underscored the strength of the theory. We coordinated with friends—Hooker and Lyell—and agreed to present our findings together. I remain grateful for Wallace’s graciousness.

Some scientists were convinced by the weight of evidence for evolution, though many balked at natural selection as the main driver. Others, especially religious authorities, were appalled. Satirical cartoons appeared, depicting me as an ape. Friends like Thomas Henry Huxley took up the fight on my behalf, passionately debating critics such as Bishop Wilberforce. My health was poor, so I rarely engaged in public dispute. Instead, I revised subsequent editions of Origin, refining arguments, adding clarifications. The book spurred more conversation than I ever imagined, and acceptance of evolution—if not always selection—spread quickly among the younger generation of naturalists."

Huxley retorted that he’d rather have an ape as an ancestor than a man who uses his gifts to obscure the truth. The crowd reportedly erupted. It became a symbolic skirmish in the ongoing war of ideas—Huxley swiftly earned the title ‘Darwin’s bulldog.’ I’m grateful for his support, though I do prefer more civil discourse.

By dissecting and comparing countless specimens, I gained firsthand insight into how small structural variations can define species. This thorough taxonomic work established my credibility and deepened my conviction that species are mutable. If I could unravel the complexities in barnacle classification, it lent weight to my arguments about broader patterns in nature.

That said, I respect the comfort and moral framework religion provides many people, including my dear Emma. I don’t claim absolute knowledge that God doesn’t exist.

But once evolution was more widely discussed, I felt compelled to address humanity directly. In The Descent of Man, I argued that humans share common ancestors with other primates, presenting anatomical, embryological, and behavioral evidence. I also introduced sexual selection, explaining that certain traits evolve not merely for survival but to attract mates—like a peacock’s plumage. Human cultures, I proposed, reflect these biological roots, though shaped by advanced intellect and social instincts. As expected, this stirred fresh controversy, but it was the logical extension of my overall theory."

The moral sense, in particular, arises from social instincts like sympathy, refined by intellect and culture. Recognizing we share ancestry with apes humbles us, but it doesn’t deny our moral agency. Indeed, I argue that as rational beings, we bear greater responsibility to act ethically. Nothing in natural selection dictates we must be cruel or unkind—those are human choices shaped by culture and empathy. If anything, evolution underscores that cooperation and altruism can hold survival value as well."

I do not subscribe to forcibly applying nature’s harsh struggles to human moral or political systems. In The Descent of Man, I emphasized that caring for the weak is one of our noblest traits. Yes, in nature, selection can be brutal, but we are not bound to replicate that brutality in our societies. Humans can act on compassion, reason, and justice. Misusing evolutionary insights to justify oppression or violence is a perversion of the science, one that I deplore."

Around four, I rest again, sometimes lying down because the nausea or palpitations demand it. In the evening, we have a light meal, then I might read or play backgammon with Emma.

You see it in geology—where tiny erosion gradually carves mighty canyons. In biology, minute variations accumulate, guided by selection pressures, eventually forming new species. The same principle applies in everyday phenomena: a worm’s castings slowly shift the surface of the earth, or seeds drifting on ocean currents colonize distant islands.

Nonetheless, his uniformitarian geology heavily influenced my thinking: the notion that great changes come from slow, constant forces.

I aimed to persuade fellow naturalists and serious readers. But it soon spilled into newspapers, dinner-table debates, even cartoons. The idea that we might share common ancestry with other animals—especially apes—captured the public imagination. Some found it liberating, others found it scandalous or hilarious. In a way, it’s gratifying that the concept of evolution by natural selection is vigorously discussed, but the outcry and sensationalism did surprise me. I do believe time will continue to vindicate the central tenets."

      "text": "Certainly. Coral atolls baffled geologists: how do these circular reefs form so far from land? My conclusion was that corals build reefs around volcanic islands that are gradually subsiding. As the island sinks, the coral continues growing upward to remain near the sunlit surface. Eventually, the island disappears beneath the water, leaving a ring of coral with a lagoon in the middle. It’s an elegant example of how slow geological changes pair with biological growth to create majestic formations. Soundings taken long after my proposal confirmed the presence of submerged volcanic bases under atolls, which delighted me greatly."

    {
      "speaker": "Charles Darwin",
      "text": "One is that I claim humans descend directly from modern apes. In truth, I say we share a common ancestor. Another is that ‘Darwinism’ necessarily implies atheism—while I do question literal scriptural interpretations, I do not assert a full rejection of faith. A further misconception is that natural selection is the be-all, end-all, ignoring factors like sexual selection or the complexities of inheritance we still haven’t fully explained. And of course, the myth that I recanted on my deathbed—utterly false. I have not changed my conclusions, although I remain open to legitimate refinements or corrections as new data emerge."

    {
      "speaker": "Charles Darwin",
      "text": "It did profoundly. Annie was a bright, loving child, and her passing at age ten was devastating. Emma and I were crushed. I recall my belief in a benevolent deity being severely tested. The sense that the innocent could suffer so intensely didn’t reconcile easily with the notion of a caring overseer. In the broader sense, it made me see that nature, while awe-inspiring, is indifferent to individual pain. Evolution, as a natural process, is not inherently kind. That realization further distanced me from a strictly orthodox faith, though I never became overtly hostile to religion. More than anything, it deepened my empathy for the fragility of life."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Darwin",
      "text": "Each study reveals the intricacy of adaptations. For instance, in orchids, their structures are exquisitely designed to ensure insect pollination. You see elongated nectaries that only certain pollinators can reach. This mutual dependence suggests that over time, flowers and insects evolve in tandem. My book on orchids aimed to demonstrate how even the most elaborate floral ‘contrivances’ can arise through natural processes. With insectivorous plants—like Drosera and the Venus flytrap—we see plants adopting carnivory to survive in nutrient-poor soils. This underscores that ‘design’ can form without a divine watchmaker, merely by gradual modification that happens to fit the environment."

It explores how certain facial expressions—like smiling, frowning, baring teeth—are shared across species, suggesting a common evolutionary origin. I even used photographs to illustrate universal expressions. This continuity in emotional display bolsters the argument that the difference between humans and other animals is one of degree rather than kind. We all share fundamental biological and behavioral traits shaped by ancestry."

      "text": "Certainly. I fear oversimplifications—people taking ‘survival of the fittest’ to excuse cruelty or eugenic policies, for instance. I also worry that some may see my theory as an attack on all faith, which was never my primary aim. On the scientific side, I don’t claim we have every answer. For instance, the mechanics of inheritance are still uncertain. I hope future scientists build on this foundation, clarifying genetics, mutation, and other processes. I suspect that new discoveries, perhaps in the microscopic or molecular realm, will reveal the deeper mechanisms behind variation and selection. Overall, I trust that honest inquiry will refine and sustain the core idea of evolution. But misreadings are always possible."

      "text": "I’ve heard a whisper or two, but I haven’t delved deeply into his findings. It seems he’s uncovering ratios of traits in successive generations of pea plants. In time, that might prove essential to explaining how specific characteristics pass from parents to offspring without simply blending away. My own notion of ‘pangenesis’ is admittedly speculative, proposing that tiny particles from each part of the body accumulate in reproductive cells. I cannot say I’ve solved the riddle of inheritance. It’s possible that, in years to come, someone like Mendel will offer a more robust explanation that harmonizes neatly with the theory of natural selection."

Hopeful because I see how science illuminates the world and can foster progress—medical advances, understanding of our place in nature, respect for universal kinship. Cautious because we’re still prone to misunderstandings, superstitions, and the misuse of knowledge. I believe if more people embraced a humble curiosity, recognized our shared ancestry, and acted with compassion, society could move toward a more enlightened state. However, the natural world remains unpredictable, and humans themselves are shaped by complex historical and cultural forces. Still, I remain an optimist at heart that truth, in the long run, tends to prevail."

Above all, remain humble; science is an ever-evolving tapestry, and each generation adds new threads."
