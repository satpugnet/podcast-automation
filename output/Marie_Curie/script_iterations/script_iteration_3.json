This is Marie Curie. Her discoveries didn't just transform science; they illuminated new ways of thinking and hoping even as the world shut doors in her face. Tonight on Echoes Through Time, we follow Leo, our endlessly curious time traveler, into the life and Parisian universe of Madame Curie. <break time=\"1.2s\" /> Her journey—marked by exceptional intellect, public adoration, private hardship, and stunning resilience—remains as vital today as ever. What made Marie Curie not only a scientific legend, but a new blueprint for what a human being—and a scientist, a woman, a mother—could be? From secret 'flying universities' in occupied Poland, to the Sorbonne's cold garrets, to Nobel fame, loss, scandal, and service at war's front lines. In her lab and in her heart, the glow never faded. <break time=\"1.0s\" /> Tonight, we aren't just meeting a myth, but a living, feeling, daring woman."

First, we crushed this pitchblende to powder, then treated it with chemicals to dissolve different components. Using Pierre's electrometer, I tracked which fractions contained radioactivity. With each separation, we followed the activity—like tracking an invisible quarry through a forest. We performed hundreds of precipitations, crystallizations, and re-dissolutions. The process required constant vigilance—one error could lose months of work. Eventually, we concentrated the radioactivity into smaller and smaller fractions until we isolated polonium and radium—though still impure. The final step to obtain pure radium chloride required thousands of recrystallizations. When we produced the first decigram of pure radium salt, it was as if we had conquered a mountain with teaspoons."

The only sophisticated instrument was Pierre's piezoelectric quartz electrometer, which measured minute electric currents produced by radiation. We had no safety equipment whatsoever—no gloves, no masks, no lead shields. Our hands became cracked and burned from chemicals and radiation. The winter cold was bitter; sometimes chemicals froze before reactions completed. In summer, the heat made fumes nearly unbearable.

Later, when we first saw the spectral lines that couldn't belong to any known element, that was confirmation more than revelation. The true 'eureka' came in small increments—watching radium chloride's luminescence grow stronger as we purified it, feeling actual heat emanating from our samples, seeing the spectroscope reveal new lines.

The processing of photographic plates required a portable darkroom with precise chemical solutions, all while moving between battlefields. We improvised lead shields from whatever materials were available. Each vehicle needed an inverter to convert direct current to alternating current for the X-ray tubes. The vehicles themselves—often donated luxury cars—required substantial modification to carry heavy equipment over damaged roads. Perhaps most challenging was developing simplified operating procedures so that women with minimal technical training could produce diagnostic-quality images under chaotic conditions."

But attitudes shifted rapidly once they saw results—bullets precisely located, fractures clearly visualized, surgical outcomes improved. War has a way of dissolving prejudice when survival is at stake. By 1915, we received more requests for units than we could fulfill. Eventually, some of the same officers who had dismissed us became our strongest advocates, requesting female radiographers by name. My daughter Irène, just seventeen, earned such respect at one field hospital that surgeons wouldn't operate without her radiographs."

I still remember the screams of men having shrapnel removed without adequate anesthesia.
