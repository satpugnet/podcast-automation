A painter whose brush changed art forever, an engineer years ahead of his time, a scientist who saw the future in a drop of blood. Today, on Echoes Through Time, we journey to the heart of the Renaissance to meet Leonardo da Vinci—artist, inventor, philosopher, and the most curious soul history has ever known."

Because I was born out of wedlock, I had no inheritance, no path set before me. But that gave me freedom. I spent days in the fields, watching the way light struck a leaf, how water twisted around a stone, how a bird's wing cut the air. My first school was nature itself. I drew everything I saw—flowers, lizards, faces, clouds. I think I was always searching for the pattern behind the surface, the reason things are as they are."

My father saw my drawings and sent me to Florence, to the workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio. There, I learned that art is not just imitation, but investigation. To paint a hand well, you must understand the bone and sinew beneath the skin. To draw a face, you must know emotion, character, and light. I found that every art is a science, and every science is an art."

He was a generous teacher, and his workshop was a forge for many talents. We made paintings, sculptures, even stage sets and mechanical devices. I learned discipline, and the pleasure of working side by side with other curious souls. The truth is, the greatest artists never stop learning—even from their own students."

Why do leaves spiral on a branch? I would spend hours watching water, drawing its eddies and swirls, then trying to capture the same movement in a woman's hair. I dissected animals, then people, to understand muscles and bones. I played the lyre, wrote riddles and fables, designed machines to lift, to fly, to amuse. I believe that everything is connected. To know one thing truly, you must know many things."

In the gardens, I met Pico della Mirandola, Marsilio Ficino, men who believed knowledge could ennoble the soul. We debated Plato, sketched statues, exchanged riddles. The city itself was a classroom—its churches, its streets, its people. I learned that creation is dialogue: with the past, with other minds, with nature herself."

I offered myself as an engineer as much as an artist; my letter to him promised bridges, fortresses, war machines, as well as painting. At court, I designed festivals that amazed the nobility—machines that made planets spin, costumes for dancers dressed as stars, automata that walked and roared. I painted the Virgin of the Rocks, a Madonna in a cave of stone, and Lady with an Ermine, a portrait blending beauty and wit. My greatest challenge was the horse—a statue so large no one had dared attempt it. I studied horse anatomy, wrote treatises, built a clay model seven meters tall. But war came; the bronze was taken to make cannons, and the horse was destroyed by the invaders. It broke my heart. Still, those years taught me scale, patience, and the bitter lesson that fate can ruin even the most careful plan."

Each apostle had to react individually, their souls visible in gesture and face. So I painted on dry plaster, using oil and tempera, so I could revise, refine. I knew it was risky; the wall was damp, and my method untested. Even in my lifetime, the colors began to flake. I regret its fragility, but not the attempt. Art must risk failure for the sake of invention. Better to strive for the impossible than to repeat what is safe."

      "speaker": "Leonardo da Vinci",
      "text": "(amused) People love mysteries, Leo. I enjoy riddles, but my paintings hold no secret codes. The Mona Lisa's smile is mysterious because I spent years studying the anatomy of laughter, the play of light, the secrets of the eye. The Last Supper is powerful because it shows the 'motions of the soul.' There are symbols, yes, as tradition demands, but no conspiracies. The real secret is to look closely, with patience. The world is full of marvels for those who see."

In her face, I sought to capture what I call 'sfumato'—the smoky transition between light and shadow, like the way dusk blends into night. Her smile changes as you look, just as real expressions do. I used layer upon layer of thin glazes—sometimes thirty or more—to create depth that seems to breathe. The landscape behind her mirrors the curves of the human form, suggesting harmony between humanity and nature. She represents everything I believe about painting—that it should be a mirror of life, not just its surface, but its essence."

My flying machines, my 'aerial screw,' are inspired by nature's designs, though our materials are still too heavy for true flight. My canal locks in Milan worked well; my textile machines were adopted. I built automata—mechanical lions, birds that flapped, a knight that moved its arms and sat up. Some machines were for war—tanks, multi-barrel guns, giant crossbows—but I often hesitated to build the most destructive. I feared what power could do in the wrong hands. Many inventions remained sketches, for want of time or patronage. Still, I believe every idea is a seed; perhaps in your age, they have grown into trees."

I mapped every bone, muscle, vein, and organ. I was the first to draw the heart's four chambers, to see how valves direct the blood. I understood the swirling vortex in the aorta, the branching of arteries and nerves. I studied the fetus in the womb, the structure of the human skull, the S-curve of the spine. I realized that the body is a machine, governed by laws as precise as those of gears and pulleys. I wished to publish my findings, but time and the Church's prohibitions intervened.

But while Michelangelo was painting the Sistine Chapel and Raphael the Vatican rooms, I received few commissions. The Pope reportedly said I was too philosophical, that I 'thinks of the end before the beginning.' I spent my time studying optics, mathematics, and fossils.

He taught me that curiosity and wonder are not just gifts, but habits, and that the courage to see connections can light the way for centuries. Until next time, keep your eyes open, and your mind even more so."

As you go about your own day, ask yourself: What would Leonardo notice? What question would he write in his notebook? Thank you for joining us on Echoes Through Time."
