Imagine a mind that saw the universe in the curve of a smile, the secret of flight in the arc of a bird's wing, and the mystery of the human soul in a single glance. Today, our time traveler Leo journeys to meet the original Renaissance man—Leonardo da Vinci. But behind the legend lies a real person: full of doubts, delights, unfinished dreams, and questions that never rest. What does genius feel like from the inside? And what can Leonardo teach us about seeing our own world anew? Let's step into his study, and find out."

Illegitimate, yet fortunate: my father's family estate gave me the freedom to roam. I explored every stream, every tree, every bird's nest. I remember, even as a boy, following the flight of birds for hours, wondering how their wings caught the air, how they turned so sharply in flight. I would kneel by the Arno's banks and watch the water twist around stones, and imagine how to draw that movement on paper. I had little formal schooling—reading, writing, some arithmetic—but my real education was in observation. I filled scraps of paper with notes and sketches, even then. The world was my teacher. And it has never ceased to amaze me."

My father, seeing my drawings, brought me to Florence. There, in the workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio, I saw what was possible. Verrocchio's studio was a world in itself: painting, sculpture, mechanics, even music and stagecraft. He let me try everything. I learned to blend colors, carve wood, fashion bronze, even to sing and play the lyre. In that place, curiosity was not just allowed—it was expected. Still, I always felt a little apart, as if my questions were too many, my interests too scattered. Even now, I wonder: is it a gift to be interested in everything, or a curse to finish so little?"

I think, 'What if I try a new technique? What if I study this muscle more closely before painting it? What if I delay, to see how light changes through the day?' And so, the work expands, and I lose myself in endless improvement, or I am drawn to a new problem that appears even more pressing. Perfection is never reached; there is always more to discover. Sometimes, I wonder if my real calling is not to finish, but to seek. I have written, 'Art is never finished, only abandoned.' This is not an excuse, but an admission: my curiosity outpaces my hands. And yet, I do regret leaving some things undone—my treatise on anatomy, the great horse for Milan, the mural in Florence. But even in the unfinished, there is value. Each attempt is a step on the path of knowledge."

When I moved to Milan, the Duke's favor allowed me greater freedom. I gained permission to study human bodies in the hospitals, sometimes by candlelight, sometimes with a doctor present, sometimes alone. In Pavia, I worked with Marcantonio della Torre, a gifted anatomist. Together, we examined more than thirty cadavers. The work was hard—the smell, the weight of mortality, the suspicion of others. Some called it sacrilege. But to me, understanding the body was not defiance of God, but reverence for His creation. I saw the mechanics of muscle and bone, the chambers of the heart, the spiral of veins. I drew what I saw, hundreds of pages, believing one day it would serve artists and doctors alike. But yes, there was always risk—of disease, of scandal, of misunderstanding. That is why so many of my discoveries sat hidden in notebooks, written in my mirrored hand, waiting for a safer time."

Sometimes, in the silence of my study, I would look at my drawings—of the heart, with its four chambers and swirling blood, or of the fetus curled in the womb—and I would ache that no physician could see what I saw. My friend Marcantonio died before we could publish our treatise. My writings, scattered and unfinished, waited for a reader who would not come in my lifetime. I chose to write in Italian, not Latin, to reach more people; but perhaps that, too, limited me. There is a loneliness in knowledge—when you see a truth so clearly, but cannot share it widely. Still, I trust that these pages will find their way, that in some future age, others will look and understand. My greatest hope is that curiosity will outlast ignorance."

In Milan, I watched kites and swallows, sketching the angle of their wings, the beating of feathers. I built models—ornithopters with flapping wings, a great aerial screw that might rise like a corkscrew through the air. I studied how air moves, how lift is generated, even how a parachute might slow a fall. I understood that human muscle was too weak for most of my designs; our bones too heavy. Yet, I believed that, someday, with the right materials and knowledge, flight would be possible. My notebooks are filled with failed attempts, calculations, corrections. But for me, the pursuit of flight was more than invention—it was a metaphor for the human spirit. We long to rise above the earth, to see with new eyes. Even the failures are steps toward that dream. I am content to have tried, and to have pointed the way."

I offered my services to Ludovico Sforza as an engineer, listing my skills in designing bridges, cannons, fortifications, even tanks. I drew chariots with spinning scythes, multi-barreled guns, armored vehicles. Yet, I confess, my heart was never in it. I witnessed the aftermath of battles—the broken bodies, the wailing of widows. I designed many weapons, but few were built. I sometimes included subtle errors in my plans, to prevent misuse. I preferred to pour my energy into machines for peace—canals, waterworks, stage devices, musical instruments. In my later years, I wrote that I regretted 'unleashing the destructive forces of man.' But in these times, invention serves many masters. I tried to use my skill wisely, but the world is not always wise."

I imagined a city with separate levels for carts and pedestrians, wide streets flooded with light, fresh water flowing through canals, waste carried away below. Houses would have gardens, air would circulate freely. I believed that beauty and health must be joined. Alas, money and tradition stood in the way. No prince would risk so radical a plan. But I drew, I calculated, I refined—hoping that one day, others would build cities with the welfare of all in mind. In France, King Francis allowed me to design a new palace at Romorantin, with rivers diverted to supply gardens and fountains. The project was begun, but never finished. Still, the dream persists. I believe that every failure plants a seed for future growth."

I layered glazes of paint, building the softness of flesh, the depth of shadow, the mystery of her smile. The background, too, is significant—a distant, almost dreamlike landscape, echoing the enigma of the human mind. I worked slowly, revisiting the painting over years, always finding something more to refine. I suppose I kept her with me because she became more than a commission—she was a meditation on the nature of being, a companion in my wanderings. People now see secrets in her eyes, codes in her smile. The truth is simpler: she is the question I never finished answering. Perhaps that is why she endures."

I questioned old explanations—how fossils came to rest on mountaintops, how the heart truly works, why the sky is blue—not to deny miracles, but to seek their mechanisms. I kept my doubts private; the world is not always kind to those who challenge dogma. But in my heart, I believe God gave us reason as a tool, and that learning brings us closer to the divine.

I studied optics, how the eye mixes colors, how shadows reveal form. In painting, I sought to mimic nature's transitions, blending tones gradually rather than outlining forms sharply. Sfumato—'like smoke'—lets the viewer's eye complete the form, creating a living, breathing presence. Chiaroscuro uses contrast to model depth, to make figures emerge from darkness. I experimented endlessly—layering, glazing, scraping away, adding again. My goal was always to evoke the illusion of life, to make the painted figure seem as real as a person standing before you. In this, I saw no line between art and science—both are ways of seeing."

These were not mere diversions; they were experiments in movement, sound, illusion. Every art, to me, is a branch of knowledge. Even a festival can teach us about the order of the cosmos, the rhythm of time. I delighted in making people marvel, to see the world anew, if only for an evening.

I even climbed to high places to release captured birds, watching carefully as they took flight, trying to understand that crucial moment when weight yields to air. The swift was another marvel—so small, yet capable of such speed and endurance. And the bat! Though not a bird, its membrane wings suggested different possibilities for human flight. Each creature revealed another secret of the air. My dream was to combine these lessons into something that might carry a man skyward.

In Milan, I designed canal locks for Ludovico Sforza, to make navigation easier between lakes and rivers. I studied how water moves—its eddies and currents, its destructive power and life-giving nature. I drew plans for diverting rivers, for machines to lift water uphill, for devices to measure its flow. In Venice, I designed systems to defend the city against Ottoman fleets, including a kind of underwater diving suit with breathing tubes of cane and a leather mask. I even sketched a form of webbed gloves for swimming faster! Water fascinates me because it is both mathematician and artist—it follows precise rules yet creates endless forms. When I paint a cascade, I am not merely depicting beauty, but also illustrating principles of motion and gravity.

I applied tempera and oil on a sealed wall. This allowed me to work slowly, to revise, to achieve those subtle expressions. But even before I finished, the paint began to flake. The refectory wall was damp; my experiment failed. Within my lifetime, as you say, it began to deteriorate. I felt... tremendous regret. I had sacrificed permanence for perfection. Ludovico Sforza was displeased; the Dominicans more so. When I see copies made by my students, I recognize the composition, but much of the subtlety is lost.

My self-propelled cart—what you might call an automobile—could have functioned; it used coiled springs for power, with programming gears to control direction. My team built a working lion automaton for King Francis that could walk, then open its chest to reveal lilies. My theatrical flying machines, using counterweights and pulleys, successfully carried actors through the air during performances. My diving apparatus—leather suit with cane breathing tubes—might have worked for shallow depths, though I recognized the problem of water pressure that I could not solve. My ball bearing designs, screw-cutting machines, and textile devices were all feasible with existing materials. But other designs exceeded our capabilities. My ornithopter—the flapping-wing flying machine—required stronger materials and a more powerful energy source than muscle could provide. My calculating device needed precision gears difficult to manufacture with available techniques. My printing press improvements and multi-barreled guns were theoretically sound but practically challenging. I faced the inventor's eternal dilemma—ideas that outpaced implementation. Yet even 'impossible' machines served a purpose: they stretched imagination, established principles, and planted seeds for future inventors to nurture when new materials and methods became available."

      "text": "Being mancino—left-handed—shaped my life in countless ways. As a child, attempts were made to 'correct' me, as the left hand was associated with sinister intentions—sinistro itself means both 'left' and 'unfavorable' in Italian. But my father, seeing my early drawings, allowed me this peculiarity. In Verrocchio's workshop, I had to adapt tools made for the right hand. I developed my distinctive mirror writing partly because, writing from right to left, my hand would not smudge the ink. This served the additional purpose of privacy, as few could easily read my notes. In painting, being left-handed gave me a different perspective—literally—on light and shadow. Some techniques I invented myself, having no right-handed example to follow. There were whispers, of course. Left-handedness was sometimes seen as a mark of deviance or rebellion. Combined with my reluctance to marry, my vegetarian diet, my scientific inquiries—it contributed to a sense that I was somehow outside normal society. Yet this outsider perspective proved valuable. It taught me early that conventional wisdom could be questioned, that there might be multiple ways to approach any challenge. Perhaps my greatest works and insights came precisely because I was forced to see the world from a slightly different angle than most."

Too many of my discoveries remained private, lost in notebooks, rather than advancing human knowledge. I would choose my patrons more carefully—placing learning above politics, stability over splendor. I would finish the great horse monument in Milan, complete my anatomy treatise, resolve the technical problems with The Last Supper. I would spend less time on war machines and more on designs for human welfare. Perhaps I would have established a true school, not just gathered individual apprentices, to ensure my methods survived me. Yet I cannot truly wish to be other than I was. My meandering path, following curiosity where it led, brought insights I might never have found through more methodical pursuit. My failures taught as much as my successes. And who can say what seemingly minor sketch or observation might yet prove valuable to those who come after? We see our lives as straight lines, but they are more like the branching patterns I studied in trees and rivers—each turn creating new possibilities. I lived the life curiosity demanded of me. That was both my limitation and my glory."
