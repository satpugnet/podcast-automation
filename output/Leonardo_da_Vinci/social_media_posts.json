His curiosity crossed boundaries: he dissected bodies, planned ideal cities, engineered stage effects, and grappled with the tension between faith and reason—all while sporting pink tunics and sketching left-handed in mirror script. But what surprised me most was the personal cost of a relentlessly wandering mind, and the quiet acceptance that unfinished work might be a badge of genuine exploration.\n\nIf seeing the Renaissance—and our own limitations—through the eyes of its most curious son sounds intriguing, take a listen. I found his doubts as fascinating as his diagrams.",
  "x": "New episode: \"Leonardo da Vinci – On Art, Science, and Wonder.\" I spoke (well, my AI time traveler did) with a man who blurred all the lines—artist, engineer, relentless question-asker, even the inventor of feature creep. Turns out, even a genius can regret not publishing their best ideas.\n\nIf you like the idea of peeking into the notebook of history's original multitasker, this one's for you."
