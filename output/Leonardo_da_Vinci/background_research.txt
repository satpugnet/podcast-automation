Leonardo da Vinci: Renaissance Genius and His Era

Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (1452–1519) stands as a quintessential Homo Universalis (Renaissance Man), excelling as a painter, engineer, scientist, inventor, architect, and anatomist ￼. Living at the height of the Italian High Renaissance, he was celebrated in his own time for masterpieces like the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, and equally revered today for his astonishing notebooks filled with foresightful sketches and scientific notes ￼. This comprehensive overview traces Leonardo’s life across Italy and France, explores his prolific activities in art and science, highlights intriguing personal quirks and anecdotes, and examines his lasting influence and the myths that surround him.

Early Life in Vinci and Florence (1452–1482)

Leonardo was born on April 15, 1452, in the hamlet of Anchiano near the village of Vinci, in the Tuscan hills outside Florence ￼. He was the illegitimate son of Ser Piero da Vinci, a respected Florentine notary, and a local woman named Caterina ￼. As a boy Leonardo grew up on his father’s family estate in Vinci, absorbing the rustic beauty of the countryside – an experience that seeded his lifelong love of nature. He had no formal surname in the modern sense (“da Vinci” simply means “of Vinci”) and was largely self-educated in subjects beyond the basic reading, writing, and abacus skills of the village school ￼.

From an early age Leonardo displayed extraordinary artistic talent and curiosity. According to early biographers, his physical appearance and charisma were striking – “outstanding physical beauty” with “infinite grace in everything he did” ￼. He was tall and athletic, known for feats of strength (Vasari claimed he could bend a horseshoe with his bare hands) and wore colorful, unconventional clothing that set him apart ￼ ￼. He also had a melodic singing voice and was an accomplished musician, playing the lyre. These talents brought the young Leonardo to the attention of Florence’s elite. In mid-1460s, around age 14, he was sent to Florence to apprentice in the prestigious workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio, a leading artist of the day ￼.

Under Verrocchio’s tutelage, Leonardo learned painting, sculpture, and mechanical arts. His earliest known drawing, a meticulous landscape of the Arno Valley sketched in 1473, already shows his keen eye for detail and perspective ￼. By 1472, he graduated from apprentice to independent master in Florence’s painters’ guild ￼. An oft-told tale (perhaps embellished by Vasari) recounts how Leonardo painted a superb angel in his master Verrocchio’s Baptism of Christ and that Verrocchio, upon seeing his pupil’s skill surpassing his own, resolved never to paint again. Whether or not literally true, the story reflects Leonardo’s emerging genius in Florence’s competitive art scene.

Leonardo’s first major commissions in Florence included an adoration of the Magi for the monks of San Donato (1481) and an altarpiece for the Palazzo Vecchio government offices (1478) ￼. However, procrastination and perfectionism already plagued him: these early projects were left unfinished, foreshadowing a pattern that would recur throughout his life ￼. An independent and inquisitive mind, Leonardo spent as much time studying nature and science as painting; he dissected animals from the butcher, sketched machinery, and debated philosophy in the Medici circles. In the late 1470s, he frequented the Medici gardens in Florence, an informal academy of humanists and artists, where he conversed with scholars like Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola ￼. This intellectual environment in Lorenzo de’ Medici’s Florence – a hotbed of Neoplatonic philosophy and artistic innovation – deeply shaped Leonardo’s outlook, encouraging his belief that “knowledge was found in nature” and that art and science were united ￼.

Yet Leonardo’s personal life in Florence had its turmoils. In 1476, at age 24, he and several young companions were accused anonymously of sodomy, a serious crime in Florence punishable by death ￼. The accusation – involving a male prostitute, Jacopo Saltarelli – was dismissed for lack of evidence, since it was unsigned and thus inadmissible ￼ ￼. Nevertheless, the public scandal likely left an impression. Leonardo never married and left little record of romantic interests, leading to modern speculation about his sexuality ￼. While we cannot know his private desires for certain, it is clear that Leonardo thereafter kept his personal life discreet. He poured his energy into work and study, developing a reputation for “lofty ideals” and an aloof focus on intellectual and artistic pursuits ￼.

First Milanese Period under Ludovico Sforza (1482–1499)

In his late twenties, Leonardo sought new opportunities beyond Florence. In 1482, bearing a letter of introduction to Ludovico Sforza (the Duke of Milan), he traveled north to Milan – a move that would define the next 17 years of his career ￼. Ludovico “il Moro” Sforza was eager to turn his court into a center of Renaissance culture rivaling Florence. Leonardo cannily pitched himself to the Duke not just as an artist but as an engineer and problem-solver. In a remarkable job application letter to Ludovico, Leonardo outlined his skills in designing bridges, fortifications, cannons, armored vehicles, and waterworks – leaving mention of his artistic talents only at the end ￼. He even brought with him an extravagant gift for the Duke: a silver lyre (lute) shaped like a horse’s head, crafted by Leonardo’s own hand to showcase both his musical ability and inventiveness ￼ ￼. Impressing Ludovico with such ingenuity, Leonardo was taken into service as a court artist-engineer.

In Milan’s ducal court, Leonardo flourished. He was entrusted with varied projects reflecting the multidisciplinary talents he had advertised. As a military engineer, he devised plans for improved city defenses and weapons. As a producer of court entertainments, he orchestrated elaborate festivals, pageants, and theatrical spectacles – even creating ingenious stage props and automata to delight the Duke’s guests ￼ ￼. (One famous later example: a mechanical lion that could walk and present lilies, built for King Francis I of France in 1515, astonishing onlookers with Leonardo’s “fabulous stage effects” ￼ ￼.) As an architect and hydraulics specialist, he conceptualized an ideal canal network to improve the city. And, of course, as a painter he produced some of his greatest masterpieces in Milan.

Painting Masterpieces in Milan: Shortly after arriving, Leonardo secured a commission to paint the Virgin of the Rocks for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception. He chose to depict the Madonna, Christ child, infant John the Baptist, and an angel in a rocky grotto setting. Leonardo’s treatment of the rocks and geology in this painting was so accurate that modern geologists marvel at it – he depicted stratified stone formations and erosion with “astounding geological accuracy,” demonstrating knowledge of sandstone and basalt textures ￼ ￼. (Indeed, Leonardo was spending time outdoors studying rock layers and fossils; his science fed his art.) The project became complicated, however, due to a dispute over payment. Leonardo and the de Predis brothers (his collaborators) felt the Confraternity wasn’t offering sufficient compensation for the innovative work. The dispute dragged on for decades. Leonardo, ever the pragmatist, sold off the first version of the Virgin of the Rocks on the side (that original painting is now in the Louvre) ￼. Only in 1506 did he reach a settlement and paint a second version (now in London), delivered in 1508 – a span of 25 years from commission to completion ￼! This episode illustrates a common challenge Leonardo faced: his ambitions for a work often exceeded what patrons expected, leading to delays and renegotiations.

Leonardo’s most celebrated Milanese painting is the Last Supper, executed on the refectory wall of Santa Maria delle Grazie between 1495–1498 ￼ ￼. This mural, depicting Jesus and his twelve disciples at the dramatic moment Christ announces “one of you will betray me,” showcases Leonardo’s supreme grasp of composition and human emotion. He masterfully arranged the figures in dynamic groups, each apostle reacting with unique expression and gesture, yet all linked by the perspectival lines converging at Christ’s head, the psychological and geometric center of the scene. The Last Supper’s naturalism and narrative power were acclaimed – “the most famous dinner in history” captured with unprecedented realism. Unfortunately, Leonardo’s experimental technique (he painted on dry wall with oil-tempera paint to allow revision, instead of true fresco) led to rapid deterioration of the mural ￼. Within a few decades it began flaking; by the 1550s Giorgio Vasari noted it was already “ruined”. Today it survives only in fragile condition (and through copies), a testament to both Leonardo’s brilliance and the technical challenges of his innovations ￼.

During these years, Leonardo also painted portraits at the Sforza court, the finest being the Lady with an Ermine (c.1489) – a radiant depiction of Cecilia Gallerani, Ludovico’s mistress. In it, Cecilia cradles a white ermine, symbol of purity and perhaps a pun on her name; Leonardo’s blending of the creature’s fur and the lady’s silken sleeve via delicate sfumato shading exemplifies his revolutionary technique of soft, lifelike modeling. This painting is among the first psychological portraits, conveying Cecilia’s intelligence and poise. Leonardo’s Milan period produced other works (Madonna of the Rocks, portraits, preparatory studies) and countless drawings in his notebooks. By the 1490s, he famously drew the Vitruvian Man (c.1490), an ideal human figure fitting in a circle and square, illustrating classical proportions. This drawing (shown below) has become an icon of the Renaissance blending of art and science, with Leonardo annotating the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius’ text around the figure in his distinctive mirror writing.

Vitruvian Man (c.1490) – Leonardo’s famous study of human proportions. The drawing exemplifies his union of art, anatomy, and geometry, with notes in his mirrored script above and below the figure. ￼ ￼

Leonardo’s service to Ludovico Sforza went beyond art and into grand-scale engineering. In the late 1480s, Ludovico tasked him with an immense project: designing the world’s largest equestrian statue in honor of Ludovico’s father, Francesco Sforza. Rising to the challenge, Leonardo undertook years of planning, even writing a treatise on horse anatomy and casting techniques. By 1493 he unveiled a colossal clay model of the horse, standing 7.3 m (24 ft) tall – an awe-inspiring sight at the Duke’s wedding festivities ￼. A staggering 70 tons of bronze were reserved for the final casting ￼. But fate intervened: in 1494, with French armies threatening Milan, Ludovico requisitioned the bronze to forge cannons for defense ￼. The great Horse was never cast. When the French invaded Milan in 1499, they found Leonardo’s clay giant in the courtyard and reportedly used it for archery target practice, shattering it to pieces ￼. This bitter failure weighed on Leonardo – a monument to his meticulous work destroyed by war and politics. (Centuries later, admirers would reconstruct “Leonardo’s horse” from his plans as a tribute.)

Beyond painting and sculpting, Leonardo’s Milan years deepened his scientific pursuits. He dissected oxen and pigs from the slaughterhouse to study muscles and bones. He delved into mathematics and geometry, collaborating in 1496 with the mathematician Luca Pacioli on De Divina Proportione, a treatise on sacred geometry for which Leonardo drew elegant illustrations of polyhedra ￼. He investigated optics and vision, writing that the eye is “the window of the soul” and prioritizing direct observation over received wisdom ￼ ￼. In secret folios, he sketched bold inventions far ahead of his time: a rudimentary flying machine inspired by bat wings, a parachute, a scuba diving suit for underwater assaults, and war machines like a multi-cannon armored tank. Leonardo’s notebooks from the 1480s-90s overflow with such designs, evidence of an uncanny foresight. (For example, he drew a schematic of a humanoid robot knight that could sit up and move its arms, making him a pioneer of robotics ￼.)

By all accounts, Leonardo became a polymathic celebrity in Milan – a favorite of Duke Ludovico, the impresario of court entertainments, and an esteemed artist-scientist whom visitors came to see. But this productive chapter ended abruptly in 1499 when Ludovico Sforza’s rule collapsed. The French armies captured Milan, forcing Leonardo to flee the city with his pupil and servant Gian Giacomo Caprotti (known as Salaì) and his friend Pacioli. After nearly 17 years, Leonardo had to leave many works (including the Last Supper and the unfinished horse) behind. At age 48, he became a wandering scholar once more.

Wanderings and the Second Florentine Period (1500–1508)

Leonardo spent the next few years traveling in Italy in search of patronage. In 1500, he visited Venice, where the Republic enlisted him as a military engineer to help devise defenses against the Ottoman Turks. Ever inventive, Leonardo proposed an early concept of a diving suit for naval sabotage – envisioning men equipped with breathing tubes to cut enemy ship hulls underwater. (He later cryptically noted he withheld publishing this idea “because of the evil nature of men,” implying he feared its misuse in war.) While in Venice, he also likely drew maps and strengthened city fortifications ￼.

By April 1501, Leonardo returned to Florence, the city he had left two decades earlier. Now he was welcomed back as a renowned master. Italy’s political landscape had shifted: Florence was no longer under Medici rule but a republic (after the theocratic interlude of Savonarola). Leonardo’s reputation earned him a commission from the new government to paint a monumental battle mural in the council hall of the Palazzo Vecchio. He was to depict the Battle of Anghiari (a 15th-century Florentine victory), while Michelangelo Buonarroti, 29 and ferociously talented, was commissioned to paint the Battle of Cascina on the opposite wall. Thus, in 1503–1504 Florence staged a legendary showdown of giants: Leonardo (now 51) and the rising star Michelangelo working side by side on dueling frescos. Tension simmered between the two geniuses. Michelangelo, brash and proud, openly disparaged Leonardo for his habit of leaving works unfinished. A famous anecdote survives: one day in Florence, a group of dignitaries asked Leonardo to clarify a passage from Dante. Not wishing to speak, Leonardo deferred: “Michelangelo will be able to explain it.” Michelangelo, passing by, took offense and snapped: “No, explain it yourself – you who couldn’t cast the horse in Milan and quit in shame!” He added, mockingly, “and those Milanese fools actually believed you!”, before storming off ￼ ￼. Leonardo was left blushing, publicly humiliated by the taunt ￼. This clash exemplifies the rivalry between Leonardo and Michelangelo, often cast as opposites: the polished courtly Leonardo vs. the tempestuous solitary Michelangelo. Despite mutual respect for each other’s skill, their relationship was indeed acrimonious ￼.

Leonardo set to work on the Battle of Anghiari with his usual zeal for innovation. He conceived a dynamic scene of soldiers on rearing horses ferociously contesting a standard. Wanting to achieve the vibrancy of oil painting on a wall, he tried a new experimental encaustic technique – using oil pigments and heat. It did not go well. As he painted in 1505, the colors began to run: when fires were lit to dry the paint, it caused the oil to drip and the mural began to deteriorate almost immediately ￼. After investing considerable time, Leonardo abandoned the project (much to Florence’s frustration) by 1506, leaving it unfinished. What he completed of the composition was so impressive that artists came to study it for years. But by the mid-16th century, Leonardo’s mural had decayed and was eventually obliterated (painted over by Vasari in 1560s) ￼. Only copies, like a drawing by Rubens, preserve its form ￼. The failed Battle of Anghiari became another entry in Leonardo’s list of brilliant but ultimately unfinished works.

Amid these projects, Leonardo in Florence painted what would become the most famous portrait in history: the Mona Lisa (La Gioconda). From about 1503 to 1506, he worked on the oil portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, the wife of a Florentine merchant. Instead of a profile view typical of the era, Leonardo painted Lisa in a three-quarter pose, hands folded serenely, set against a mysterious distant landscape. He employed his full repertoire of techniques: exquisitely subtle sfumato modeling (soft transitions of light and shadow) to give a lifelike softness to her face, and a delicately enigmatic smile that seems to shift with the viewer’s angle. The Mona Lisa’s naturalism was so striking that Vasari wrote “her eyes had the luster and moisture of life” and that one could see the pulse in her throat (though Vasari likely never saw it, his account testifies to its early renown). Leonardo never delivered the portrait to the patron; he kept the Mona Lisa with him wherever he went for the rest of his life ￼, continually refining it. This hints at how special the work was to him, perhaps an embodiment of his artistic ideals. By blending Lisa’s identity with a cosmic landscape and an eternal calm, Leonardo created a portrait that transcends its subject – which is partly why legends and mysteries (from identity theories to hidden code conspiracies) have surrounded the Mona Lisa for centuries. In reality, it is simply the consummation of Leonardo’s painting skill and deep study of human mood.

During these Florentine years, Leonardo was also immersed in scientific and engineering endeavors. In 1502, he briefly entered the service of the infamous warlord Cesare Borgia (son of Pope Alexander VI) as a military architect and engineer ￼. In Borgia’s company, Leonardo traveled across central Italy inspecting fortresses and drafting maps. He produced an amazingly precise map of the town of Imola (1502) for Cesare Borgia ￼, using innovative surveying methods. The Imola map is essentially an early aerial view – “as if seen from above”, every street and building drawn to scale ￼ – one of the first scientifically accurate town maps in Europe. Leonardo also helped Borgia plan siege works and improved artillery. Though this position with the ruthless Borgia might seem at odds with Leonardo’s humanist spirit, it exemplified the Renaissance reality that even artists had to navigate the politics of war to earn patronage. (There is an apocryphal tale that Leonardo witnessed Cesare’s cold-blooded murder of rival captains at Senigallia and was horrified, but historically it’s unconfirmed. What’s certain is Leonardo left Borgia’s service by 1503.)

Returning to Florence in 1503, Leonardo continued to consult on engineering projects. Notably, he and Niccolò Machiavelli worked together on an ambitious scheme to alter the course of the Arno River, aiming to both flood Pisa (Florence’s enemy) and reclaim land ￼. Leonardo designed canals and pumping systems for this grand project. The venture ultimately failed – the excavated canal collapsed – but it showed Leonardo applying his engineering to civic planning. He also brainstormed an “ideal city” with straight wide streets and efficient sewage and canal systems, perhaps influenced by a plague that struck Milan in 1480s. Though unrealized, these sketches are seen as early urban planning concepts.

By 1506, Leonardo’s patronage shifted again. That year, Charles d’Amboise, the French governor of Milan (which France had recaptured), invited Leonardo back to Milan. Louis XII of France, who now ruled Milan, admired Leonardo and wanted him in residence. Florence, despite valuing Leonardo’s renown, granted him leave (the Florentine Republic even wrote to Louis XII recommending Leonardo’s artistry) ￼. Leonardo gladly returned north, leaving the Battle of Anghiari unfinished. In doing so he escaped the uncomfortable rivalry with Michelangelo and perhaps the political uncertainty in Florence (where the Medici would soon return to power in 1512). Thus began Leonardo’s Second Milanese Period under French rule.

Second Milanese Period and Rome (1508–1516)

Leonardo resettled in Milan by 1508, in service of the French kings (Louis XII, then after 1515, Francis I). Now in his mid-50s, he focused less on grand paintings and more on scientific study and teaching. The French provided him a stipend and freedom, and he divided his time between Milan and trips to Florence (to sort family inheritance issues) until 1513. During these years he completed a second version of Virgin of the Rocks (delivered 1508, as mentioned) ￼, and likely finished the haunting Virgin and Child with St. Anne painting around 1510 (a complex composition of Mary seated on her mother Anne’s lap, with the Christ child and a lamb). But much of his energy went into anatomy and natural science.

Working with the young anatomist Marcantonio della Torre at the University of Pavia around 1510–11, Leonardo performed a series of human dissections – unprecedented for an artist. He had dissected perhaps a dozen cadavers in earlier years; now he set out to compile a thorough treatise on human anatomy. Over about two years, Leonardo dissected more than 30 human corpses (both male and female, young and old) and made hundreds of astonishingly detailed anatomical drawings ￼. These include studies of the skeletal system, muscles, internal organs, the human brain and heart, and even the human fetus in the womb. His famous drawing of a fetus curled in a uterus, surrounded by detailed notes, is both scientifically accurate and artistically profound, merging biology and mysticism. Leonardo correctly deduced many features of human physiology: for instance, he understood the circulation of blood in the heart well enough to see how valves direct flow (he observed the swirling of blood in the aortic valve, a fact only confirmed by modern science in the 20th century). He described the arteriosclerosis he found in an old man’s arteries, linking it to the man’s death – essentially recognizing cardiovascular disease. He noted the function of the liver and atherosclerosis of vessels. In studying the heart, he wrote, “the heart has four chambers”, refuting the then-common belief of two. All this he recorded in mirror-written notes and cross-sectional diagrams of astounding clarity. Had he published them, Leonardo would have been a founder of modern anatomy. But these papers remained largely unseen until centuries after his death. (Frustratingly, his collaborator Marcantonio died of plague in 1511, halting their plan to publish an illustrated anatomy atlas.)

Leonardo’s scientific notebooks from this period also delve into botany, geology, astronomy, and physics. He studied plant morphology, noting the spiral growth of branches and the annual rings of trees. He investigated water flows and turbulence, sketching the eddies in rivers and the action of waves. His observations of fossils in northern Italy’s mountains led him to a revolutionary conclusion: those high rocks were once undersea. He argued that the presence of seashell fossils on mountains could not be explained by Noah’s Flood (as his contemporaries assumed) but by the land itself having risen: “as mountains formed, they lifted marine sediments – carrying fossil-bearing rocks skyward to become mountain peaks,” Leonardo concluded ￼. This insight, along with recognizing distinct geological strata, was centuries ahead of geology – in effect, Leonardo posited an ancient Earth shaped by slow natural processes, anticipating modern stratigraphy ￼ ￼. In astronomy, he understood the phenomenon of earthshine (the faint illumination of the dark side of the crescent moon by light reflected from Earth), and mused that the Earth is a star much like the moon (even speculating that the Earth might not be the universe’s center, an idea echoing Copernican theory, though he did not fully endorse heliocentrism). He also attempted to explain why the sky is blue (correctly attributing it to the way air scatters sunlight) and why distant mountains appear blue (an early grasp of atmospheric perspective).

In 1513, geopolitical tides turned again: the French were expelled from Milan by the Holy League, and the Medici family returned to power in Florence. Pope Leo X – born Giovanni de’ Medici – invited Leonardo to Rome, possibly thinking to employ the renowned master in papal projects. Leonardo, now in his 60s, went to Rome in late 1513 and stayed for three years at the Belvedere Villa in the Vatican, under the patronage of the Pope’s brother Giuliano de’ Medici. Rome at this time was a buzzing hive of High Renaissance art: Michelangelo was painting the Sistine Chapel ceiling (completed 1512) and planning the Pope’s tomb; Raphael was frescoing the Vatican Stanze and designing tapestries. These younger artists enjoyed Leo X’s favor, while Leonardo found himself oddly sidelined. The Pope Leo, although a Medici and a lover of the arts, is said to have been impatient with Leonardo’s slow, experimental methods. There is a story that Leonardo began working on a new painting in Rome by painstakingly concocting a mix of unusual varnishes or mediums. Upon hearing this, Pope Leo quipped with exasperation: “This man will never accomplish anything, he thinks of the end before the beginning!” ￼ ￼. This reputed remark (though possibly apocryphal) encapsulates the common criticism of Leonardo’s approach – that he overthought projects and seldom delivered on time. Indeed, in Rome Leonardo engaged mostly in research: he studied optics (conducting experiments on lenses and light – some rumors say he tried to build an enormous burning mirror or camera obscura setups), continued minor anatomical studies (until the Pope forbade further human dissection in Rome’s hospitals), and advised on architecture (he drew up plans for draining the Pontine Marshes south of Rome). But he received no major commissions from the papacy, likely a blow to his finances and pride. A small project to paint a panel of Leda and the Swan for Giuliano de’ Medici occupied him, but he left it unfinished. Surrounded by the whirlwind successes of Raphael and Michelangelo, the elder Leonardo cut a somewhat peripheral figure in Rome.

One bright spot in Rome was Leonardo’s apprentices and friendships. His longtime pupil Salaì was still with him (though more a servant; Salaì was a troublemaker – his nickname means “Little Devil,” earned by stealing and mischief – yet Leonardo tolerated him for 30 years and even left him some paintings in his will). A more devoted protege, the young nobleman Francesco Melzi, had joined Leonardo around 1505 and became like a foster son to him ￼. In Rome, Melzi managed Leonardo’s household and notes. Leonardo also befriended some mathematicians and thinkers in Leo X’s court, such as Fra’ Luca Pacioli earlier and perhaps the architect Donato Bramante (who had been in Milan and was now building St. Peter’s). Nonetheless, by 1516 Leonardo was restless and looking for patronage anew – and an unexpected offer arrived from the King of France.

Final Years in France under Francis I (1516–1519)

In 1515, France (under the young King Francis I) retook Milan after the Battle of Marignano. The dynamic Francis, a great admirer of the Italian Renaissance, met Leonardo that year in Bologna (where Leonardo famously presented his mechanical lion automaton to the king, which opened to reveal fleur-de-lis flowers ￼ ￼). Francis was eager to bring Italian masters to his court. In 1516, he invited Leonardo to France, offering him the title “Premier Painter and Engineer and Architect to the King.” Tired of Italian power struggles and appreciative of Francis’s genuine adulation, Leonardo accepted. He left Rome, taking with him his notebooks, scientific instruments, and a few precious paintings – notably the Mona Lisa, St. John the Baptist, and Virgin and Child with St. Anne (all of which he would show to inquisitive visitors in France) ￼.

Leonardo spent his final three years in France in comfortable semi-retirement. The King gave him the Manor of Cloux (Clos Lucé) near the royal Château d’Amboise in the Loire Valley, and an ample pension. Though in his mid-60s and physically ailing, Leonardo continued to sketch and devise projects for the King. He drew plans for an ambitious “ideal city” at Romorantin – Francis I envisioned a new palace and town, and Leonardo integrated his ideas of water management and architecture into this plan ￼ ￼. He proposed diverting a river to run through gardens and the town, to prevent flooding and provide a canal network ￼. Francis began some works (digging a canal in 1518) but eventually shifted focus to expanding Chambord instead; Leonardo’s French urban dream was left unrealized ￼. Leonardo also may have advised on the design of Château de Chambord – some historians see his hand in its double-helix staircase and Italianate layout, though this is debated.

Despite diminishing mobility, Leonardo’s mind stayed sharp and curious. An interesting account comes from October 1517, when Cardinal Luigi d’Aragona visited him at Clos Lucé. The Cardinal’s secretary, Antonio de Beatis, recorded that Leonardo, though he had “a certain paralysis in the right hand,” was still able to draw and teach others ￼. (Leonardo likely suffered a stroke or nerve damage around 1516, causing his right hand to claw up – ironically his right, since he was left-handed in writing and sketching. This meant he could no longer paint fine details but could write and draw left-handed as before ￼ ￼.) De Beatis notes that Leonardo showed them three paintings – “a Florentine lady, done from life, at the instance of Giuliano de’ Medici” (the Mona Lisa), “a young St. John the Baptist”, and “a Madonna and Child with St. Anne” – and that “one cannot expect him to do any more good work” owing to his paralysis, “yet he can still design and instruct others” ￼. It’s a touching snapshot of the aging master, arm incapacitated but intellect intact, sharing his treasures and insights with visitors who regarded him with reverence.

Leonardo was treated with affection and honor by King Francis I. Legend has it that the king and the artist formed a close friendship – Francis would often visit Leonardo for long discussions about art and science. In a famously romanticized anecdote (originating from 16th-century sources and later dramatized in a painting by Ingres), King Francis cradled Leonardo’s head as he died on May 2, 1519, in the manor at Cloux. While it’s unlikely Francis was literally present at the final moment (records suggest he was elsewhere), the story symbolizes the high esteem in which Leonardo was held at the French court. Leonardo died at 67, probably of a stroke. In his will, he bequeathed his manuscripts, notebooks, and instruments to Francesco Melzi – effectively entrusting Melzi with his intellectual legacy ￼ – and left Mona Lisa and other paintings to Salaì (these were eventually sold to Francis, which is how the Mona Lisa entered the French royal collection) ￼. He was buried in the cloister of the Church of Saint-Florentin in Amboise. (That church was later destroyed; presumed fragments of his remains now rest in the Chapel of Saint-Hubert at Amboise.)

Thus ended the life of Leonardo da Vinci – but in many ways, his legend was only beginning.

Artistic Achievements and Techniques

Leonardo’s artistic output, though not vast in number, includes some of humanity’s greatest art works. His paintings were prized by contemporaries and became templates for later generations. Key features characterize Leonardo’s art: soulful expression, refined chiaroscuro and sfumato, innovative composition, and an unrivaled fidelity to nature.
	•	Sfumato and Chiaroscuro: Leonardo introduced the technique of sfumato (Italian for “vanished in smoke”), a subtle blending of tones and colors without harsh outlines. This created a lifelike softness and ambiguity especially in flesh and atmospheric effects. In the Mona Lisa, one observes sfumato in the gentle transitions around her eyes and mouth, which give that elusive smile its magic. Vasari described the painting’s lifelikeness, noting that the “eyes had the lustre and moisture of life” and the skin appeared real ￼ ￼. Leonardo combined sfumato with chiaroscuro (contrasting light and shadow) to model forms in three dimensions. His figures, like the apostles in the Last Supper, have a solidity and presence due to this careful shading. An observer wrote that Leonardo’s colors were blended “without borders, in the manner of smoke”, making outlines disappear. This was a radical departure from the flatter, linear look of earlier painting.
	•	Emotional Expression and Naturalism: Leonardo sought to capture the “motions of the mind” in faces and gestures. He wrote that a good painter must depict the “intentions of the soul” through bodily movement ￼ ￼. In the Last Supper, for example, each apostle’s posture and expression visibly reflects shock, anger, or disbelief at Christ’s announcement – a breakthrough in narrative realism. Similarly, in his portraiture (Mona Lisa, Lady with an Ermine), the slight tilt of the head, the glint of the eyes, or the curve of lips convey a living psychology. This was “something of the miraculous,” as one early admirer put it ￼. Leonardo’s anatomical studies also enabled him to render the human form with unprecedented accuracy: he understood the mechanics of the smile, the musculature of a twisting torso, the fall of light on a skull. And he extended that keen observation to the natural world in the background of his paintings – craggy mountains, wandering rivers, atmospheric haze – all painted with geological and optical realism (his Virgin of the Rocks is a prime example, doubling as a precise geological study ￼ ￼).
	•	Composition and Perspective: Leonardo was a master of arranging figures harmoniously. He often composed in pyramidal structures (e.g. the Virgin of the Rocks and St. Anne paintings have the figures in a stable pyramid form). In the Last Supper, he grouped the apostles in rhythmic sets of three, creating visual order out of chaos. He also pushed the use of linear perspective – notably in the Last Supper’s architectural background, which creates a powerful illusion of depth leading to Christ’s figure ￼ ￼. In early works like his unfinished Adoration of the Magi, he made a detailed perspective underdrawing for complex architectural ruins in the background ￼. Leonardo even played with anamorphic perspective (distorted imagery that appears normal from a certain angle or via a curved mirror) – he is credited with the first known use of it ￼. These explorations show his scientific approach to vision and representation.
	•	Notable Works: Among Leonardo’s finished paintings, the Mona Lisa remains the most famous – celebrated for its portrait of “La Gioconda” with an ambiguous smile and a background that symbolically mirrors human psychology. The Last Supper, though damaged, is revered for its composition and emotional depth; it has been endlessly studied and reproduced (and unfortunately, sensationalized by fiction – contrary to fanciful theories, it contains no hidden codes about Mary Magdalene or secret societies; it was painted per traditional Christian themes ￼ ￼). The Virgin of the Rocks exists in two versions, both showcasing Leonardo’s ability to integrate figures into a realistic landscape and to convey sacred themes with natural tenderness rather than stiff halos. Lady with an Ermine is a cornerstone of Renaissance portraiture, introducing dynamic pose and narrative (the woman interacting with the pet). Leonardo’s drawings themselves are considered works of art: the Vitruvian Man, his anatomical sketches (the fetus in utero, the grotesque caricatures of faces, the studies of cats and dragons), and designs of fantastic machines are all admired for their line work and inventiveness.
	•	Unfinished and Lost Works: Leonardo left several paintings unfinished, which nonetheless influenced others. His Adoration of the Magi (1481, Uffizi) in its raw underpainted form was studied by artists for its bold composition and energy. The cartoon (large drawing) for St. Anne, Mary, and Jesus (1507, National Gallery, London) was famously displayed in Florence and seen by young Raphael, who borrowed elements for his own works. The Battle of Anghiari mural, though lost, survived long enough in copies to inspire Peter Paul Rubens and other Baroque painters with its intense muscular battle scene. Additionally, some paintings attributed to Leonardo remain contentious (like La Bella Principessa and the small Salvator Mundi, which sold for a record sum in 2017 but whose attribution is debated by experts). Even Leonardo’s notebooks full of sketches can be counted as part of his artistic legacy – for instance, his delicate studies of flowing water or designs for stage costumes (he drew imaginative costumes for festivals, including people dressed as planets or animals) are artworks in their own right.

Leonardo’s relentless pursuit of perfection meant he produced fewer completed paintings than contemporaries (fewer than 20 survive to us). Yet, as he wrote, “Art is never finished, only abandoned.” This oft-attributed quote (whether verbatim his or a later summary of his mindset) rings true – he would rather abandon a work than consider it imperfect. Those paintings he did complete permanently transformed the art of painting, marrying the realistic observation of nature with the poetic imagination of the artist.

Ingenious Machines and Engineering Designs

While Leonardo earned his contemporaries’ esteem primarily as a painter, he spent equal if not more time devising machines, gadgets, and inventions. In an era before the concept of a “scientist” or “engineer” existed as a profession, Leonardo charted unknown territory. His notebooks detail a vast array of contraptions, often centuries ahead of their time, reflecting his motto that “mechanics is the paradise of the mathematical sciences” ￼. He approached engineering empirically, building on earlier medieval engineers but elevating design to an art form.

Some of Leonardo’s most famous invention concepts include:
	•	Flying Machines: Obsessed with the dream of human flight, Leonardo closely observed birds and bats. He filled pages with drawings of wings, parachutes, and ornithopters. One striking design is a man-powered ornithopter with enormous membranous wings meant to flap like a bat’s. Another is the “Aerial Screw,” essentially a helicopter prototype: a linen canopy in the shape of a screw, intended to be rotated rapidly by four men to lift off ￼ ￼. Leonardo described how if made of stiff linen sealed with starch, and turned quickly, “the said screw will make its spiral in the air and it will rise high”, effectively theorizing the principle of a rotary wing ￼ ￼. Modern analysis shows his helicopter wouldn’t have worked – too heavy and human-powered – but the concept is sound and clearly anticipates the helicopter. (A small working model of Leonardo’s helicopter screw has been built in modern times.) He also sketched a parachute (a pyramid-shaped linen canopy) to allow a person to descend safely from heights – which was actually tested in 2000 by a skydiver who found Leonardo’s parachute design did indeed work! ￼.

A modern model of Leonardo’s “Aerial Screw,” often considered a precursor to the helicopter. He conceived a 15-foot diameter rotor made of reed and linen; turned by cranks, it was meant to compress air to achieve lift. Although never built in his time, the concept of lift through a rotating air screw was revolutionary ￼ ￼.
	•	War Machines: Serving ducal and papal warlords, Leonardo devised fearsome tools of war. He drew plans for an armored tank – a turtle-like vehicle covered in metal plates and bristling with light cannons arranged 360 degrees ￼. It was to be propelled by men inside turning cranks (in one drawing he mistakenly gears the cranks opposite, which some speculate was deliberate to prevent actual misuse). The design essentially foreshadows modern armored vehicles. He also invented a giant crossbow (ballista) with a sixteen-yard span meant to hurl huge stones – an intimidating siege engine for psychological warfare as much as function. Additionally, he sketched multi-barreled machine guns (a cart with rows of cannons that could be fired in volleys and swiveled to cool down, solving the reload time problem) and improved catapults, battering rams, and fortress designs. His notes often emphasize the goal of terrifying the enemy with noise and spectacle – for instance, a horse-drawn chariot with spinning scythes on the wheels to mow down foes. It’s somewhat paradoxical that the same man who wrote of the sanctity of life and the ugliness of war also spent creativity on weapons. Likely, he saw it as applying knowledge to whatever problems his patrons posed; in Renaissance Italy, military innovation was a valued skill. (He did sometimes acknowledge the horror of war – he painted a poignant drawing of the “Battlefield after a Battle” with mangled corpses, and in his later years wrote about peace. But early on, he pragmatically lent his mind to war devices to gain patronage.)
	•	Hydraulic and Civil Engineering: Leonardo had a lifelong interest in water – “the driving force of nature,” he called it. He engineered plans for improving rivers and canals, envisioning canal locks, dredging machines, and even an entire Arno River diversion as noted earlier. He also drew designs for a moveable bridge for armies (easy to pack and deploy), as he advertised to Ludovico Sforza ￼. In one instance, he planned a colossal stone bridge over the Golden Horn in Constantinople for the Ottoman Sultan (a single-span 240-meter bridge). Though not built in his time, a version of this bridge was constructed in 2001 in Turkey, demonstrating the viability of his design. Leonardo sketched equipment like gear-driven pumps, rotary mills, crank mechanisms, and flying crane devices. His drawings in the Codex Atlanticus show plans for water wheels and textile machines, reflecting a broad understanding of mechanical engineering.
	•	Robotics and Automata: Centuries before robotics, Leonardo created self-operating devices. He famously designed a mechanical knight (1495) that could sit up, wave its arms, and maybe move its head and jaw, using an intricate system of pulleys and gears inside an armored suit ￼ ￼. This “robot” was likely built in some form and displayed at a Milanese festival. He also made automated lions (as mentioned, one for Francis I in 1515) ￼ and a mechanical automaton bird (some speculate he built a mechanical flying bird or a self-propelling cart considered a precursor to the automobile). His notes include designs for a self-propelled cart with spring mechanisms – effectively a wind-up car – and a programmable automaton that could move along a predetermined path (this has been called the first robotic vehicle). These inventions highlight Leonardo’s ability to combine knowledge of anatomy (joints and muscles) with engineering to mimic life. In a sense, he was testing the boundaries between the living and mechanical.
	•	Musical Instruments and Other Designs: Leonardo’s inventiveness extended to music. He improved existing instruments and conceived new ones. A notable design is the viola organista, a keyboard instrument that uses rotating wheels (wrapped in horse hair) that bow the strings as keys are pressed – essentially an early concept of a continuous-bow piano. (This instrument was actually built and successfully played in 2013 by a Polish concert pianist, producing ethereal sounds.) He also devised new types of flutes and drums, including a mechanical drum that could be carted and played by geared action (possibly for battlefield morale). Additionally, in architecture, he drew numerous plans for centralized churches (circular, symmetrical plans inspired by ideal proportions) and civil buildings. While none of his architectural designs were built in his lifetime, they influenced others like Bramante and later architects who saw his drawings.

It’s important to note that Leonardo rarely (if ever) constructed these machines in full scale. They lived on paper and in prototypes. In some cases, that was fortunate – for instance, he designed a submarine-like diving suit but then wrote that revealing it would let “men commit murders at the bottom of the seas”, so he withheld details. Much of his engineering served as thought experiments or demonstration of principles. Still, what makes them extraordinary is how they prefigured technology developed long after. NASA engineers have cited Leonardo’s drawings of a robotic knight and a flying machine as inspiration for modern projects ￼ ￼. Military historians consider his tank and multi-gun designs conceptual forerunners to modern armored vehicles and machine guns. His technical drawings with exploded views and cross-sections introduced a new visual language for engineering. He even anticipated the scientific method in a rudimentary way – he wrote, “Experience is the mistress of those who wrote before, and so I rely on experiment rather than their words”, refusing to accept authority without testing ￼.

Leonardo’s only limitation was perhaps the state of materials and power in his era. Lacking light strong metals, engines, or electricity, his ideas could not be realized. But he imagined mechanisms (gears, screws, pulleys, springs) that form the backbone of modern machinery. Indeed, many of his smaller inventions did work and were copied: for example, he improved the spinning machine for silkmaking, and designed a better printing press with a flywheel for even pressure, which printers later adopted.

Scientific Studies and Anatomical Insights

Leonardo’s scientific achievements were largely unknown to his contemporaries (since he didn’t publish), but today we recognize him as a visionary in multiple sciences:
	•	Anatomy and Physiology: As noted, Leonardo dissected human corpses and made the most accurate anatomical drawings of the Renaissance. He mapped the human skeleton and muscles with engineering precision, comparing the body to a machine. He was the first to draw the human spine correctly as an S-shape with intervertebral discs. He produced the first accurate depiction of the human fetus in utero (including the surrounding womb and umbilical vessels) ￼ – an image striking even today for its compassion and detail. He correctly identified the frontal sinus in the skull and the presence of the maxillary sinus, which most contemporaries missed. He understood circulation in a rudimentary way: he knew blood flowed from the heart through arteries and returned via veins (though the full circulation loop was discovered a century later by Harvey). He performed a pioneering experiment on a heart: he made a glass model of the heart and pumped water with grass seeds in it to observe flow, discovering the swirling vortex that occurs as blood passes through the aortic valve – thereby explaining how the valve closes, a phenomenon not understood until the 20th century. In embryology, he correctly surmised that the maternal and fetal blood circulations are separate (based on his dissection of a gravid cow). Such conclusions were far beyond the knowledge of 1500. Leonardo intended to publish a treatise “On the Human Body” with over 200 drawings, which would have revolutionized anatomy – but upon his death, these drawings went into Melzi’s care and then lay dispersed for centuries, known only to a few.
	•	Zoology and Botany: Leonardo studied animal anatomy too, dissecting cows, birds, monkeys, bears, and even a whale (a stranded whale on a shore was examined by him, as he notes). He compared horse and human anatomy, looking for homologies. In his bestiary notes, he displays a keen eye for animal behavior and form. He had a particular fascination with birds – analyzing how they maneuver their wings, which informed his flight designs. In botany, he noted the geometrical patterns in plant growth: for instance, he observed that all branches of a tree at a given height collectively equal the thickness of the trunk (now known as Leonardo’s Rule for tree branching) – a rule of plant physiology confirmed by modern botanists. He also studied tree ring thickness relative to yearly growth. In a famous to-do list from the 1490s, one entry reads: “Describe the tongue of the woodpecker.” Indeed, Leonardo was curious about even the most obscure details of nature ￼ ￼. (For the record, a woodpecker’s tongue is exceptionally long and wraps around its skull – something anatomists eventually documented; we don’t know if Leonardo ever solved that puzzle, but the fact he wanted to shows his relentless curiosity ￼.) He wrote dozens of fables and observations about animals, revealing a proto-ecological awareness – for example, he mused on how water and soil erosion shape landscapes and how fossils indicate ancient life.
	•	Geology and Earth Science: As described earlier, Leonardo deduced from marine fossils on mountaintops that the Earth undergoes slow changes over long periods, opposing the idea of a single biblical flood creating these phenomena ￼. He postulated deep time and processes of sedimentation and erosion, basically outlining the principles of geomorphology. He was puzzled by the nature of fossils (were they once living? He concluded yes, they were ancient seashells). He categorized rocks and gems, noted the patterns of rock strata near rivers, and accurately drew maps with topographical features. In one experiment, he observed fossilized shells in different positions and concluded they couldn’t have been transported by a single flood due to their delicate orientation ￼, thus arguing for in-situ deposition over time. This was a remarkably scientific approach, relying on evidence to challenge prevailing dogma.
	•	Physics – Light, Optics, and Mechanics: Leonardo’s study of light and vision made him an early pioneer in optics. He understood the camera obscura principle (projecting an image through a pinhole) and used it to explain how the eye works like a camera – an idea he conveyed in sketches of an eye with lines of sight. He correctly asserted that light travels in straight lines and studied the inversion of images in a camera obscura. He attempted to measure the angle of reflection of light and experimented with mirrors, even spherical ones. In mechanics, he formulated basic laws of friction (anticipating Amontons’ laws by 150 years) and noted that friction is independent of contact area given constant weight – something he found by sliding blocks. He also observed the idea of action and reaction in mechanical systems, a precursor to Newton’s third law. In hydrodynamics, his drawings of water flow include “streamlines” and turbulent vortices that are qualitatively accurate; he noted how water current is faster in narrow channels and slows in wider sections (continuity principle).

Leonardo practiced a form of the scientific method without a formal framework: he would pose a question (e.g., how do birds fly? how does the heart valve work?), then observe, dissect or experiment, and record findings meticulously, often accompanied by hypotheses. He lacked mathematical language to generalize his findings (Galileo and Newton would later provide that), so his science remained mostly qualitative. But within those qualitative studies lay gems of understanding far ahead of his peers.

One of his guiding scientific principles was experience (empiricism). He wrote scathingly of scholars who just cited ancient authorities: “Those who are in love with practice without knowledge are like the sailor who boards ship without rudder or compass”, insisting that theory must come from practice and observation ￼ ￼. He championed experiment and observation over dogma, making him a progenitor of Renaissance empiricism. This approach is evident in his various lists of things to investigate – a famous example from his notebooks lists tasks like “obtain a skull, observe the moon’s light, describe the jaw of a crocodile, make a list of the muscles, learn how to repair a lock, ask the professor of Pavia about proportion, measure the sun’s angle” – a breathtaking range of curiosity ￼ ￼. Each item was a problem to solve or a phenomenon to explain.

Sadly, because Leonardo did not publish these findings, his scientific impact was delayed. Some of his manuscripts were seen by a few after his death (sections on painting were compiled into a treatise published in 1651, and portions of his notes on water were circulated). But many of his most advanced anatomical and scientific notes remained unknown until the 19th and 20th centuries when his Codices were rediscovered and studied. Only then did the world fully appreciate how ahead of his time he was.

Personality, Habits, and Quirks

Leonardo da Vinci’s personality has fascinated people as much as his works. He was described by contemporaries as a man of “grace and charm”, quiet dignity, and deep contemplation ￼. Several core traits and interesting quirks stand out:
	•	Insatiable Curiosity: Above all, Leonardo’s defining trait was a boundless curiosity. He wanted to know everything about everything. This drove his habit of carrying notebooks everywhere to jot down observations, questions, sketches. A famous page of his notes includes seemingly random tasks: “measure the sun,” “describe the tongue of the woodpecker,” “explain the flow of blood in the heart,” “get the master of arithmetic to show you how to square a triangle,” etc. ￼ ￼. No detail of nature was too small to examine – from the way curling hair resembles fluid eddies, to the structure of a dragonfly’s wing, to the formation of laughter lines on a face. This curiosity gave him a sometimes scattered approach (he jumped from project to project as new questions arose), but it fueled his genius. A quote attributed to him encapsulates this: “Learning never exhausts the mind.” Indeed, he kept learning new things into his 60s.
	•	Mirror Writing: Leonardo famously wrote most of his notes backwards, from right-to-left in mirror script. This has invited conspiracy theories that he wanted to keep his ideas secret, but the likely explanation is more practical: Leonardo was left-handed, and writing leftward prevented the ink from smudging as his hand moved across the page ￼ ￼. Contemporary accounts and handwriting analysis confirm his left-handedness, though he could write and draw with the right as well (ambidexterity) ￼. No “decoding” is really necessary for his notebooks – they read normally when held to a mirror ￼. It appears he did not expect a wide audience for his private notes, so he wrote in the way easiest for him. This mirror writing added to his aura of mystery later, but was likely just a personal quirk.
	•	Perfectionism and Procrastination: Leonardo had a notorious difficulty finishing projects. He took on commissions enthusiastically, but often his interest would wane as the initial concept gave way to the grind of execution or if a new idea captivated him. He then procrastinated or pursued tangents (e.g., doing a scientific study of optics in the middle of painting the Last Supper). Many patrons grew frustrated at his slow pace. As early as the 1480s, the Duke of Milan had to pressure him to finish the Virgin of the Rocks, and in 1490s the Monks of Milan took legal action to get their painting delivered ￼. In Florence, the Signoria had to urge him to work faster on the wall mural, to no avail. The Pope’s comment about “thinking of the end before the beginning” reflects this reputation ￼ ￼. Yet, Leonardo’s procrastination was partly born of his relentless search for excellence. He was known to say that “art is never finished, only abandoned,” implying there’s always room for refinement. For instance, he kept the Mona Lisa with him for years, adding subtle glazes of paint and fine tweaks that contribute to its depth. When he did finish something, it was superb; when he didn’t, it was often because his standards were impossibly high or his interests had moved beyond the scope of the commission.
	•	Humanist Ethos and Character: Those who met Leonardo spoke of his kindness and generosity. Vasari recounts that he had such compassion that “he would buy caged birds at the market, just to set them free” (a popular anecdote illustrating his empathy for living creatures, though its primary source is uncertain). He was reportedly a vegetarian or at least significantly cut meat from his diet – one 16th-century account claims he did not eat meat, unusual for the time, possibly out of ethical concern (though another speculation is that he believed a plant-based diet healthier; in his notes he does link heavy meat consumption to certain ailments). Leonardo was also known for personal charm – he was elegant in conversation, witty, and a good improviser of fables and riddles to entertain courtiers.
	•	Appearance and Fashion: Leonardo’s appearance signaled his individuality. He wore his hair long and flowing at a time most men cut theirs shorter, and later in life grew a long beard that spilled onto his chest (self-portraits and a description by Vasari confirm the long waving beard). He dressed in brightly colored tunics, often rose-pink or purple, and shorter than was the norm for his age – essentially dressing like a youth when he was older ￼. This sense of style and self-presentation made him stand out. He carried himself with a calm, confident demeanor described as almost regal.
	•	Social Relationships: Though private in some ways, Leonardo was by no means a hermit – he had a circle of pupils and friends. He was notably tolerant and patient with his apprentices. Salaì, for example, stole money and wine, and made a mess of paintings, yet Leonardo kept him around and even affectionately drew caricatures of him. He gave Salaì that nickname meaning “Little Devil”, suggesting a playful indulgence of the boy’s antics. Francesco Melzi, on the other hand, was studious and devoted; Leonardo made him essentially family. In a letter to Leonardo’s brothers after the master’s death, Melzi wrote that everyone was “grieved at the loss of such a man, who was like an excellent father to me” ￼. Leonardo also maintained friendships with eminent people – e.g., he was friendly with Lorenzo de’ Medici who sent him to Milan, with the mathematician Pacioli, with Machiavelli briefly in Florence, and with nobles at various courts. Interestingly, Leonardo did not have the bitter temper or rivalry urges that some contemporaries did (Michelangelo had a notoriously volatile temper; Leonardo by contrast was more even-keeled, if a bit prideful). When Michelangelo insulted him, Leonardo didn’t respond in kind, showing a measure of restraint. He seemed secure in his abilities and less interested in petty feuds – though he certainly had a competitive pride in the realm of intellect and art. (In his notes he sometimes critiques other scholars or highlights his own discoveries with a tone of superiority, but not publicly.)
	•	Philosophical and Spiritual Views: Leonardo had a complex view of the world that combined deep reverence for nature with skepticism of received doctrine. He was raised Christian and produced profoundly spiritual artworks, yet he also approached subjects like anatomy and geology empirically, sometimes challenging literal religious explanations. For example, his notes imply doubt about the biblical flood and perhaps even a subtle challenge to young-Earth timelines ￼ ￼. However, Leonardo was not irreligious; he infused his art with Christian symbolism and took commissions for religious works throughout life. Possibly, like many humanists, he found God in Nature – studying creation to get closer to the Creator. Ethically, he had a strong sense of universal harmony: he wrote about the interconnectedness of all things, how “everything proceeds from everything else… and everything is made one”. He seemed to espouse kindness, rationality, and the pursuit of truth as guiding principles.

One quirk often noted is that Leonardo loved puzzles and wordplay. He wrote many of his thoughts in short fables or paradoxes. For instance, he wrote “We see more of the surface of the Moon than of our own Earth” (referring to how we can observe the moon’s face but not Earth’s entire globe). He enjoyed posing riddles like “I live on air but if you remove my head I shall water your plants” (answer: a watering can, in Italian wordplay). This playful side made him something of a court entertainer too, composing witty sayings for festivals. It also shows how his mind leapt between logical analysis and imaginative metaphor.

Friends, Rivalries, and Patrons

Throughout his life, Leonardo interacted with many luminaries of Renaissance Italy, forging alliances and sometimes rivalries:
	•	The Medici: In Florence, the Medici family played a role in Leonardo’s career. As a young artist, he likely benefited from the general Medici patronage of the arts and their humanist academy (meeting scholars in their orbit ￼). Lorenzo de’ Medici reputedly sent Leonardo to Milan in 1482 with the silver lyre as a diplomatic gift for Ludovico Sforza ￼, effectively acting as a talent agent for Leonardo’s skills. Later, two Medici popes, Leo X and Giuliano de’ Medici, gave him quarters in Rome, though not significant commissions. Some suggest petty court politics (and perhaps Michelangelo’s and Raphael’s influence) limited Leonardo’s opportunities under the Medici Pope. Nonetheless, Leo X respected Leonardo enough to employ him on engineering schemes (like draining marshes). After Leonardo’s death, Medici rulers in Florence sought to retrieve some of his manuscripts (a negotiation with Melzi happened decades later), indicating ongoing respect.
	•	Ludovico Sforza (Il Moro): Arguably Leonardo’s most supportive patron, Ludovico treated him well, involving him in all manner of court projects for nearly 17 years. Leonardo in turn had great loyalty to Ludovico, referring to him as “my patron” in writings. When Ludovico was imprisoned by the French in 1500, Leonardo grieved the fall of the Sforza court. Interestingly, even years after, Leonardo kept a portrait of Cecilia Gallerani (Ludovico’s mistress) perhaps as a memento of those Milan days. Ludovico’s trust in Leonardo to design the gigantic horse and important religious frescoes shows the mutual esteem. Their relationship was professional but warm – Leonardo flourished in Milan’s environment which Ludovico cultivated for him.
	•	Michelangelo: The relationship with Michelangelo was notoriously strained. Michelangelo was much younger (born 23 years later) and rose to fame in Leonardo’s mature years. Michelangelo seemed to harbor some resentment or jealousy toward Leonardo, perhaps perceiving him as an establishment figure supported by the Medici whom Michelangelo often clashed with. The public insult anecdote in Florence’s streets (mentioned earlier) ￼ suggests real animosity. Additionally, when Michelangelo unveiled his David in 1504, a committee including Leonardo considered where to place it – there’s an (unsubstantiated) story that Leonardo argued it should be in a less prominent spot, which if true could hint at envy. Later, in Rome, Michelangelo supposedly derided Leonardo for not accomplishing more sculpture or finishing the Battle mural. For his part, Leonardo at times criticized Michelangelo’s style implicitly – extolling painting’s subtlety over sculpture’s “dirty toil” (Michelangelo primarily sculpted). He once wrote that a sculptor’s face ends up covered in marble dust and sweat, whereas a painter “sits at ease before his work, well-dressed”, etc., a passage some interpret as a jibe at Michelangelo. It’s also said that in 1515, when both were in Florence, Pope Leo X considered having them collaborate on a project and Leonardo diplomatically refused to work with his long-time rival. Despite tensions, each respected the other’s genius – they just had very different temperaments and philosophies. Their rivalry has become the stuff of legend (subject of books like “The Lost Battles” and innumerable art history comparisons) ￼, and it arguably pushed both to excel. Florence’s public recognized it: an early writer said “there had never been two such men at the same time”, highlighting how extraordinary it was to have Leonardo and Michelangelo in one city.
	•	Raphael: Leonardo did not have a direct relationship with Raphael (who was 31 years younger), but Raphael absorbed much from Leonardo’s work. During Raphael’s 1504–1508 sojourn in Florence, he studied the works of Leonardo. Raphael’s portraits of women (like Maddalena Doni or La Gravida) clearly emulate the Mona Lisa’s three-quarter pose, folded hands, and landscape background. He even borrowed the soft sfumato for a time, and one of Raphael’s madonna paintings includes a young John the Baptist very reminiscent of Leonardo’s types. It is recorded that Raphael visited Leonardo’s studio and saw the plans for the Battle of Anghiari. In Rome, Raphael and Leonardo overlapped briefly (Raphael was employed by the Vatican, Leonardo under Medici patronage), but Raphael held great respect for him – evident in Raphael’s famous School of Athens fresco, where he painted a Plato with Leonardo’s likeness (Plato, the wise philosopher, pointing upward, is a portrait of Leonardo with flowing gray hair and beard) ￼ ￼. It was Raphael’s nod to Leonardo as a towering intellectual figure.
	•	Bramante and Other Peers: In Milan, Leonardo was friendly with Donato Bramante, the architect who also hailed from near Florence and was working on Santa Maria presso San Satiro and later the new St. Peter’s. They shared interests in geometry and antiquity. It’s speculated Bramante gave Leonardo early access to Milan’s libraries of architectural treatises. In 1506, Bramante (by then in Rome) reportedly helped secure a papal bull to allow Leonardo to use human cadavers for dissection at the hospital of Santa Spirito in Rome – an intriguing possible collaboration (not confirmed, but plausible since Bramante was related by marriage to the Pope and a fellow artist). Leonardo also knew Cesare Borgia, albeit briefly, and in a letter addressed him in neutral, respectful tone. With Machiavelli, he collaborated on the Arno project; Machiavelli, a pragmatic thinker, likely found Leonardo’s technical expertise useful, though there’s little personal commentary on each other.
	•	King Francis I: In his final years, Leonardo developed a warm rapport with Francis I of France. Francis, only in his early 20s when Leonardo came to court, revered the aging master and called him “Father.” They would have philosophical conversations; Francis once remarked that “no other man had been born who knew as much as Leonardo,” a testament to how comprehensive Leonardo’s knowledge appeared ￼ ￼. The King’s support allowed Leonardo to reflect and compile notes without pressure. The famous (if apocryphal) death scene of Leonardo dying in the King’s arms reflects Francis’s genuine admiration. After Leonardo’s passing, Francis is quoted: “I cannot believe that a man such as he has ever lived in this world.” The French court thus became crucial in preserving some of Leonardo’s legacy: Francis kept the Mona Lisa and other works safe in royal collections, and Melzi, while in France, guarded Leonardo’s manuscripts (though after Melzi’s own death, those got scattered).

In summary, Leonardo navigated the tricky waters of Renaissance patronage deftly: securing the favor of princes, popes, and kings by offering services in whatever they valued – be it a painting, a pageant, or a fortification plan. He generally avoided political entanglements (unlike Michelangelo, who wrote passionate sonnets to Florence’s Republic, Leonardo stayed neutral). This allowed him to work under very different regimes – Medici Florence, Sforza Milan, Borgia Romagna, Papal Rome, Valois France – adaptable and respected in each. He valued companionship (e.g., of his students) but also relished solitude for thinking. By all accounts he was a genial, fascinating personality who left a strong positive impression on those who met him.

Legacy and Influence

Leonardo da Vinci’s legacy is colossal – not only in art, but in science, engineering, and the popular imagination of what a “genius” is. After his death, his reputation went through phases:

In the 16th century, Giorgio Vasari’s Lives of the Artists (1550/1568) cemented Leonardo’s legend, calling him an artist of “uncanny beauty and grace” and recounting marvels like the dragon automaton he made and how “there was a halo around him of grandeur” ￼. Vasari placed Leonardo on a pedestal as the initiator of the High Renaissance style, praising his Mona Lisa and Last Supper lavishly. This ensured that later artists studied Leonardo’s works. However, because many of his works were unfinished or lost and his notebooks unpublished, some of his contributions were less known. By the 17th century, figures like Galileo or Descartes likely had no idea Leonardo anticipated many scientific ideas – his notes remained in private collections. His artistic techniques, though, did influence all of European painting: the use of sfumato and careful anatomical poses was adopted by masters in the Netherlands, Spain, and beyond (for instance, one can trace Leonardo’s influence in the works of Albrecht Dürer who met Melzi in 1520 and saw some of Leonardo’s drawings, and in the chiaroscuro of Caravaggio a century later).

Leonardo’s manuscripts gradually resurfaced: the Treatise on Painting, compiled from his notes by Melzi, was first published in 1651, spreading his artistic theories. In the 18th century, the term “Renaissance Man” came into use, with Leonardo as its exemplar – one who has universal curiosity and capability. The 19th century Victorians elevated Leonardo further: the painting “Mona Lisa” became an object of fascination (French poet Theophile Gautier wrote a poem to it; English art critic Walter Pater wrote in 1869 of “the unfathomable smile” and gave Mona Lisa a cult status in his essay, famously saying she is older than the rocks she sits among, with “like the vampire, she has been dead many times and learned the secrets of the grave” – an evocative, if overwrought tribute ￼ ￼). Romantic and Symbolist artists saw Leonardo as a mystic.

By the 20th century, Leonardo’s notebooks were fully published and studied, revealing the extent of his scientific genius. He became admired not just as a great artist but as a visionary scientist – popular books touted him as having “invented the airplane, tank, submarine” etc., albeit conceptually. Exhibitions of his drawings and models of his machines toured worldwide, inspiring engineers. For example, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (pioneer of rocketry) praised Leonardo’s early helicopter idea, and Orville Wright noted that reading about Leonardo’s studies gave him confidence in pursuing flight. In medicine, Leonardo is now seen as a forerunner of modern anatomical illustration and even forensic facial reconstruction (he studied how to depict the aged face versus the youthful face, to help artists). Geologists hail him for his proto-uniformitarian view that Earth changes over long periods ￼ ￼. Each field finds something remarkably modern in Leonardo.

Leonardo’s broad approach to knowledge – combining art, science, and technology – became a role model for interdisciplinary innovation. In the 21st century, institutions and awards are named after him (the “Da Vinci” surgical robot system, for instance, acknowledging his mechanical ingenuity ￼). His name is practically synonymous with “genius” – appearing in everything from the Da Vinci Science Center to the Leonardo da Vinci Award for innovation.

In popular culture, Leonardo has been featured in novels (e.g., Irving Stone’s The Agony and the Ecstasy touches on him, and of course Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code – which, despite its gross historical fabrications, further cemented him in the popular mind as a mysterious sage). Films and TV often reference him; even children’s cartoons depict him with whirligig helicopters and paintbrush in hand.

However, along with fame came myths and misconceptions which are important to clear up:
	•	Leonardo as a secret occult master: Fueled by fiction like The Da Vinci Code, some imagine Leonardo hid secret codes in his art or was part of clandestine knowledge societies. There is no evidence Leonardo was involved in esoteric secret orders. He was indeed secretive about some research (likely to avoid ridicule or theft of ideas), but not an occultist hiding messages for future generations. For instance, the idea that the Last Supper has hidden Mary Magdalene or Grail symbols is baseless – Leonardo painted it to conform to traditional Christian theology as requested by his patron ￼ ￼. Scholars note his works content is not unorthodox for the time ￼. He was a man of science and reason and an artist of deep spiritual expression, but not some cryptic prophet encoding mysteries.
	•	Mirror writing for secrecy: As discussed, he wrote in reverse mostly for convenience as a left-hander ￼. He didn’t invent a cipher – anyone can read his script with a mirror, and his contemporaries like Melzi did so. His notebooks were not published widely simply because they were voluminous private notes and somewhat disorganized, not because they were deliberately encrypted. They were known in certain circles after his death; at least by the 1560s, artists like Lomazzo referenced Leonardo’s writings. Extracts were eventually published in the 17th century ￼ ￼. So the popular notion that his work remained “undecoded” for centuries is exaggerated ￼.
	•	He invented X or Y technology outright: It’s common to see claims like “Leonardo invented the helicopter, bicycle, automobile, etc.” In truth, he conceptualized machines analogous to these, but they were not built or fully practical. For example, a sketch of a bicycle often attributed to Leonardo (found in the Codex Atlanticus) is now believed to be a 20th-century hoax or a later addition by someone else – there’s no evidence Leonardo drew a bicycle (the sketch’s style doesn’t match his hand). So one must be cautious separating Leonardo’s authentic ideas from later attributions. Nonetheless, many real modern devices have roots in his conceptual drawings (the helicopter, tank, diving suit as mentioned, also the ball bearing – he drew an early form of it to reduce friction in rotating mechanisms, a principle used everywhere today).
	•	Leonardo’s personal life: His sexuality remains a matter of speculation. The 1476 sodomy case suggests he may have been homosexual or bisexual, but after that scare, little is recorded. Some try to link him romantically to female subjects like Cecilia Gallerani or the mysterious “La Belle Ferronnière,” but there’s no concrete evidence he had affairs with women (and he never wed, which was uncommon but not unheard of for an artist in those days). Most likely, as many biographers conclude, he had amorous feelings towards men (perhaps including his beloved pupil Salaì, who was described as extremely handsome in youth) ￼. Yet Leonardo’s own writings on love are sparse. In one note he calls sexual intercourse “the cause of the greatest joys and the cause of the greatest pains” and says if not for procreation it would be “foul and undue”, an oddly negative view ￼ ￼. He also wrote that “intellectual passion drives out sensuality”, reflecting perhaps an asexual or ascetic tendency as he got older ￼. In any case, his sexual orientation can only be conjectured (“very probably” gay according to many modern scholars ￼). What’s clear is he formed close bonds (like with Melzi) that were deeply affectionate. Modern attempts to psychoanalyze (like Freud infamously tried to link the Mona Lisa to Leonardo’s mother) are largely speculative and not grounded in evidence.
	•	A universal genius without weakness: While celebrated, Leonardo was not superhuman. He had weaknesses: disorganization (his papers were a jumble even he sometimes struggled to arrange, evident from his constant cross-referencing and rewriting notes); overambition (taking on huge tasks beyond the means of one man of his time); and at times he struggled with perfection paralysis – not finishing for fear it wasn’t perfect. Also, some of his scientific theories were wrong – e.g., he believed basalt in mountains was formed by the cooling of sand in water, a mistaken idea. But remarkably, many errors were minor compared to his insights.

Leonardo’s legacy also lies in the inspiration he provides. He stands as evidence that art and science are not separate domains, but rather complementary modes of exploration. He famously wrote, “Study the science of art. Study the art of science. Develop your senses – especially learn how to see. Realize that everything connects to everything else.” Such wisdom is cited by modern interdisciplinary thinkers. In fields like robotics, for instance, engineers cite Leonardo’s approach of learning from nature (his robotic knight came from studying human anatomy; today’s biomimicry in robotics echoes that). In medicine, illustrators still look to his anatomical drawings as models of clarity and accuracy, and heart researchers marveled at how he saw the vortex in the aorta 500 years before MRI imaging did.

Finally, Leonardo’s artistic legacy specifically is enormous: without him, the High Renaissance style might not have blossomed as it did. Artists from Raphael to Caravaggio to Rembrandt owe something to his techniques of lighting and composition. The Mona Lisa became the prototype of the psychological portrait, influencing portrait painters through the centuries (one can trace a line from Mona Lisa to portraits by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, to even contemporary photographers who seek that enigmatic expression). The Last Supper composition has been referenced repeatedly in art and pop culture due to its iconic status. Even his unfinished works gave rise to new art genres (for example, the fascination with the non finito, or deliberately unfinished aesthetic, as seen later in Michelangelo’s unfinished sculptures, might draw from seeing Leonardo’s incomplete Adoration).

In summary, Leonardo’s influence permeates modern engineering (concepts of helicopters, tanks, robots, scientific illustration), modern art (realistic painting techniques, unified composition, expressive content), and even modern thought (the ideal of the polymath). No wonder the world celebrates him in exhibitions, movies, and literature to this day.

Myths and Misconceptions

To appreciate Leonardo accurately, it’s worth debunking a few persistent myths:
	•	Myth: Leonardo put secret codes or messages in his paintings. – False. Apart from playful tricks of perspective or symbolism common to the era, there’s no evidence he hid any deliberate secret information in his art ￼ ￼. For instance, claims of special letters painted in the Mona Lisa’s eyes or an “M” in the Last Supper are products of overactive imaginations. Renaissance painters did sometimes include symbols (Leonardo included recognizable symbols like John the Baptist’s attributes, etc.), but nothing like the conspiracies proposed in fiction.
	•	Myth: Leonardo was at odds with the Church or a heretic. – False. While his scientific findings quietly challenged some orthodoxy (like fossils and Earth’s age), Leonardo worked for church institutions frequently (he painted many Madonna and religious scenes, and in Rome was under Vatican patronage). He kept his heterodox ideas private and showed outward conformity to Christian faith. He was given Christian burial. There’s no record of any heresy investigation against him. If anything, he was a man of faith in reason, trying to reconcile understanding the world with spiritual wonder, typical of Renaissance humanists bridging medieval and modern thought.
	•	Myth: Leonardo invented the “da Vinci” surgical robot or other modern things. – Misleading. The Da Vinci Surgical System is named in his honor, not invented by him. Likewise, things like the “Leonardo Bridge” built in Norway in 2001 are modern engineers realizing his design. Leonardo provided the vision, not the finished product. His brilliance lies in conceptualization and observation rather than manufacturing; nothing operational like an airplane or car existed until much later, using technologies (motors, engines) that he did not have. However, his designs show he conceptually understood the principles decades to centuries early.
	•	Myth: The Shroud of Turin was created by Leonardo (a fringe theory) – False. Some have wildly theorized that Leonardo fabricated the Shroud of Turin as a photographic experiment. This has no credible basis: carbon dating of the shroud and historical references place it before Leonardo’s time, and there’s zero mention in any of his voluminous notes of such a thing. It’s an example of how Leonardo’s name gets attached to mysteries simply because of his reputation as an ingenious experimenter.
	•	Misconception: “Da Vinci” is Leonardo’s last name. – Clarification: “da Vinci” just means “from Vinci,” his hometown. In modern usage we call him Leonardo da Vinci to distinguish him from other Leonardos, but calling him “da Vinci” in casual reference (e.g. “painted by da Vinci”) is common and not incorrect per se. Just note that in his time he’d simply be “Leonardo.” This is a minor point, but people sometimes (mistakenly) refer to him as “Vinci” which is wrong (that’s the town).

Leonardo da Vinci remains a figure of endless fascination. As a final personal touch, consider Leonardo’s own words and philosophy, which shine light on how he thought:
	•	He wrote: “Iron rusts from disuse; stagnant water loses its purity… even so does inaction sap the vigor of the mind.” ￼ This was Leonardo’s creed – the mind must stay active and curious to remain strong. He certainly lived up to it, never ceasing his investigations.
	•	On the relationship of art and science he said, “Study the science of art. Study the art of science. Develop your senses – learn how to see. Realize that everything connects to everything else.” (This quote, though often attributed to him in modern sources, paraphrases the ethos that runs through his notebooks.) Indeed, Leonardo’s genius was seeing connections across disciplines.
	•	In a moment of self-effacing doubt, he lamented: “Tell me if anything at all was done. … I have offended God and mankind for my work did not reach the quality it should have.” This note was found in his papers ￼ ￼. It is poignant – this giant of achievement still felt at times like he “failed” by not completing more. It reminds us that he was human, with frustrations and unmet goals.

Yet, looking at the breadth of Leonardo’s life and impact, one cannot but echo the sentiment of Francesco Melzi, who wrote that “everyone is grieved at the loss of such a man that Nature no longer has it in her power to produce” ￼. Leonardo was truly one of a kind – a blend of artist, scientist, engineer and philosopher. His era, the Renaissance, was richer for him living in it, and our era remains inspired by the legacy he left. Five hundred years later, the conversation with Leonardo da Vinci continues – through his art hanging in museums, his ideas fueling new innovations, and the enduring example he sets that curiosity and creativity know no bounds.
