  "linkedin": "New episode out: Echoes Through Time meets \"Alan Turing – The Genius Who Taught Machines to Think (and Ran Past the Geniuses That Couldn't).\"\n\nAlan Turing might be best known for breaking Enigma, but his story is much fuller (and quirkier) than wartime heroics. Imagine a marathon-running mathematician who wore a gas mask on his bike due to hay fever, calculated bicycle chain slips instead of fixing them, and once buried silver in the woods with a code only he could (theoretically) crack. Turing’s vision gave us the theoretical foundations of modern computing and artificial intelligence, but the twists—his infamous padlocked mug, his habit of talking to temperamental machines as “dear electronic children,” his deep capacity for friendship (and candor about who he was)—reveal a person as complex as the puzzles he unraveled. His legacy was shaped by both astonishing breakthroughs and the brute force of prejudice—so the episode also steps thoughtfully into the tension between technological progress and social justice in postwar Britain. I found his quiet philosophy particularly striking: that some mysteries—like love, loss, or the limits of knowledge—are best faced with honesty (and a dash of humility).\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered about the real mind behind the “Turing machine” or wanted to hear what it’s like to battle both ciphers and social convention, this conversation offers plenty to ponder. Would love for you to give it a listen.",
  "x": "New Echoes Through Time: Alan Turing—not just the guy who cracked Enigma, but the original computer nerd, marathoner, inventor of the Turing machine, and owner of arguably the world’s most secure mug. Turns out, genius is as much about quirks as equations.\n\nIf you’re curious why your phone’s brain (and jokes about lost buried silver) trace back to one very unconventional hero, check out the episode. It’s as fascinating as Turing’s running shoes."
