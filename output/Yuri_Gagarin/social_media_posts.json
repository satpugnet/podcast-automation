  "linkedin": "A new episode of Echoes Through Time is out: \"Yuri Gagarin – The First Human in Space: Orbits, Childhood, and a Smile That United the World\".\n\nGagarin’s 1961 orbit wasn’t just a scientific leap; it was a moment when a farm boy from war-torn Russia, shaped by loss and hope, became humanity’s ambassador to the cosmos (with an infamous grin and a risky parachute jump). His journey threads through Cold War secrecy, accidental traditions (the cosmonaut pee ritual—thanks, nerves), and dangerous heroics, all while staying strangely relatable. Gagarin’s perspective from orbit, “The Earth is blue,” is poetic, but his reflections from the ground—on ordinary roots, pressurized heroism, and reluctant myth-making—are even more revealing.\n\nIf you’re curious what history’s most famous smile can teach about courage, fallibility, and the weight of being a symbol, join me for this conversation. It’s a glimpse behind the legend, and an ode to the pioneering spirit that (hopefully) outlasts nations and medals.",
  "x": "New Echoes Through Time: Yuri Gagarin. He was the first to orbit Earth—farm kid, war survivor, sudden global icon, and accidental trendsetter (yes, cosmonaut rituals included). His jump into history is more human than heroic.\nCurious how one smile changed the world? Give it a listen."
