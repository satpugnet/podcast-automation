Today on Echoes Through Time, we unfasten the capsule’s hatch and step into the heart of Star City, deep in the Soviet spring of 1962, to join Leo as he meets the boy from Klushino who became the first to circle the globe—and changed it forever."

Engineers dart between concrete-block offices, instructors bellow on a distant parade ground. Inside one sunlit room, a battered flight helmet, models of Sputnik, and a single photograph of a smiling family tell their stories more simply than any propaganda poster ever could. Leo, uncertain-footed and wide-eyed, is about to step across decades and meet history’s new face of courage. The kettle whistles. The legend, in blue Air Force tunic, beckons him in."

In 1943, both my older brother and sister were seized and sent to work in Germany. We hid tools in the ground, learned to listen for the sounds of tanks in the distance. Some mornings, survival was the highest ambition."

When I started pilot training, my commander looked me up and down and said, ‘We ordered pilots, not schoolboys!’ I had to sit on an extra cushion to see the landing strip. It was good for a laugh.

The physical part was like boot camp for the soul: spinning until you’re sick, learning to survive in freezing forests, even designing your own parachute landing. Still, the science was more difficult, especially with the pressure to never let the Americans beat us."
