One of its sons steps ashore, after wandering farther than anyone can believe. Some say he’s ‘Il Milione,’ the man of a million fantastical tales; others whisper he’s merely a merchant with a few too many good stories. But in every corner, children and scholars gasp at his words: golden courts, dog-headed men, dragons… and paper money far away in Cathay. Was he really there? Or is this just another Venice tall tale? Today, on Echoes Through Time, we step into the mind—and memory—of Marco Polo. Why do his stories matter, centuries later? Why do we still seek the wonders he claimed to see? Stick with us. This isn’t just the story of the Silk Road—this is the story of discovering the limits of belief itself."

Our host sets aside his merchant’s ledger and listens, as a curious young visitor—who calls himself Leo—steps through the carved wooden door.

And as I knelt, he fixed his gaze upon me—a youth from the far edge of the world. My tongue failed me, but I bowed low. Kublai had the bearing of Genghis’s grandson and the curiosity of a philosopher. He welcomed us, not as beggars, but as worthy guests."

I served as an official in Yangzhou, overseeing taxes. Some whispered of favoritism; a few tested my abilities. Yet performance, not blood, was the measure in Kublai’s court.

I offer what memory preserves—and failures of record do not erase lived days."

Once, in the marshes near Yunnan, our party was nearly swept away in floods; in Burma, elephants led war parties through steaming jungles. As emissaries, we traveled with armed escort, but no rank guards against fever, accident, or the blades of rebels. And yet, in every trial, the world grew richer and less terrifying. After a few years, fear becomes another shade of the horizon. The longing for Venice, though, never left me."

In one hall, priests, in another lamas, and yet elsewhere, imams. Kublai himself kept an open heart and a cautious mind. He sought to understand each creed, knowing empire rests on harmony more than on swords. For me, raised a Catholic, it was strange and—over years—a lesson in humility. Not all roads to heaven look alike."
