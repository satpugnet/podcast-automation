  "linkedin": "A new episode of Echoes Through Time is out: \"Marco Polo – Unveiling East and West: The Untold Impact of a Venetian Explorer.\"  \n\nThis week, I had one of those surreal (and, well, fictional) fireside chats with Marco Polo—whose journeys made my own sense of “adventure” (i.e., not getting lost in Venice) look a bit unimpressive. We explored what it meant to see the world’s largest cities when most of Europe was still thinking “big” meant a bustling fair; how paper money, coal, and cosmopolitan tolerance were not wild theories but living realities in Kublai Khan’s empire; and why Marco considered curiosity a greater inheritance than any spice-laden merchant ship. We touched on his run-ins with skepticism (Venetians gave him the nickname ‘Il Milione’ for a reason), his role as both observer and participant in a true global moment, and that odd feeling of coming home to find your world suddenly smaller—or just more precious.  \n\nIf you’re interested in how travel can fracture and then reconstruct your own map of reality (or just want to know why Marco Polo was both right and sometimes maybe... “embellishing”), I’d love for you to listen in.",
  "x": "New Echoes Through Time: \"Marco Polo – Unveiling East and West\". From braving deserts to deciphering paper money, Marco’s tales made the world both bigger and more bizarre. (Also: He swore he didn’t even tell half of it.)  \n\nGive it a listen if you’re curious about the real impacts—and misadventures—behind the legend."
