  "linkedin": "A new Echoes Through Time episode is out: 'Vincent van Gogh – The Soul Behind the Brush.'\n\nThis week, my AI time-traveling host Leo journeys to the sunlit gardens of 1889 Saint-Rémy to meet Van Gogh himself—less the myth, more the man. Turns out, Vincent’s world was more than yellow sunflowers and ‘mad genius’ clichés; it’s a landscape of obsessive work (over 900 paintings in a decade), radiant color with almost no black, half a lifetime’s worth of letters to his brother, and struggles that most of us would rather keep private. What fascinated me most: his conviction that suffering can, strangely enough, prime us for seeing beauty where others don’t (though he’d bristle at the trope of art springing from madness). There’s something quietly radical in how he dignified potato-eating peasants and painted light even into darkness—reminding us that compassion doesn’t have to be loud to be revolutionary. In Vincent’s world, to “work and dare” isn’t just an artist’s mantra, but kind of a survival philosophy.\n\nIf you’re curious about the human behind the paint—his challenges, tiny joys, messy hopes, and whether all artists really do eat yellow paint—I think you’ll find this episode illuminating. I’d love for you to listen and share what makes Van Gogh feel most real to you.",
  "x": "New episode: Echoes Through Time meets Van Gogh—beyond the ear and the sunflowers. Turns out, he painted with more hope (and far less black paint) than myth allows. Potato eaters, consumed coffee, candor, and color: all present.\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered about the real soul behind the brush, this one’s worth a listen."
