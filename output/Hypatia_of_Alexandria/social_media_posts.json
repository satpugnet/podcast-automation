  "linkedin": "New episode of Echoes Through Time: “Hypatia of Alexandria.”\n\nThis week, my AI-powered time travel host, Leo, visits Alexandria in 415 CE to meet Hypatia—a polymath who navigated the city’s labyrinth of faith, politics, and science. Hypatia was equal parts mathematics mentor, political advisor, and philosopher; she taught in open-air courtyards, composed mathematical commentaries that may have shaped algebra centuries later, and made friends (and a few enemies) across deep religious divides. Her daily life mixed crafting astrolabes with candid debates about truth, courage (and sometimes, the cost of standing apart). I couldn't help but reflect on how her patient rationalism—persisting as tides of zealotry rose—is as urgent now as it was then.\n\nIf curiosity, complexity, and intellectual stubbornness appeal to you, join me in exploring Hypatia's world—her humor, her doubts, and her humanity. Maybe we need her kind of wisdom more than ever.",
  "x": "Hypatia of Alexandria is our Echoes Through Time guest: mathematician, philosopher, and advisor in a city teetering between reason and fanaticism. She built scientific instruments, counseled governors, and faced danger with wit and clarity (her tribôn game was strong).\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered what it costs to keep wisdom alive during an age of division, this episode might hit home. Give it a listen if you’re curious."
