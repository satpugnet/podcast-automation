  "linkedin": "New episode out: Hypatia of Alexandria\n\nHypatia was a mathematician, philosopher, teacher—and arguably, the last light of Alexandria’s classical age. Navigating a city dense with both scrolls and sectarian strife, she stood out for her clear thinking and (let’s be honest) audacious public lectures. She didn’t just preserve Greek mathematics—she clarified it, edited works like Ptolemy’s Almagest, and mentored thinkers across pagan and Christian lines, all while fielding accusations of sorcery and fashioning scientific gadgets with her own hands. We tend to romanticize the 'martyr for reason' angle, but what’s more striking is her willingness to teach anyone with honest questions—and her quiet refusal to shrink from danger, even as Alexandria’s mood darkened.\n\nIf you’re curious about what courage, inquiry, and a stubborn devotion to knowledge look like under real pressure, this conversation might be up your alley. I think you’ll find both the resonance and the very human awkwardness of a life lived for wisdom.",
  "x": "New episode: Hypatia of Alexandria—a philosopher who turned the streets of ancient Alexandria into her classroom, taught math to future bishops (while sidestepping mobs), and built scientific gadgets long before it was cool.\n\nGive it a listen if you want history with sharp questions and surprisingly modern echoes."
