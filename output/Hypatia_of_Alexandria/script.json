  "title": "Hypatia of Alexandria - Mathematician, Philosopher, and Teacher in 5th Century Egypt",
  "description": "Leo steps into the vibrant yet volatile Alexandria of 415 CE to meet Hypatia, philosopher-mathematician and advisor to rulers. Across bustling streets and quiet study halls, Hypatia reveals the meaning behind her legendary intellect, recounts moments of laughter and peril, and reflects candidly on science, faith, political intrigue, and the cost of wisdom in a divided world. Their conversation uncovers never-told stories, hard truths about persecution, and lessons that echo through the centuries.",

Here in the 5th century, culture, faith, and intellect flow as freely as Nile water, but beneath it all runs a fierce, unseen tension. In these tangled boulevards—where philosophers teach by sunlight and mobs sometimes judge by moonlight—our story finds its heart."

Hers is a life built beside candles and compasses, lived out beneath both adoration and danger. We will discover a world where mathematics could save a life, and teaching could end it. We'll ask: How did a philosopher become a symbol for learning—and a target for fear?"
