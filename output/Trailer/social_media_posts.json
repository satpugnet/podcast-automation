  "linkedin": "A brand new experiment is live: the Echoes Through Time podcast trailer is out. I’m inviting you to meet Leo—our intrepid time traveler—who’s on a curious mission to chat with history’s heavyweights (think: Napoleon, Cleopatra, Marcus Aurelius, Darwin). The trailer packs a quick auditory trip across centuries, highlighting just how eccentric (and surprisingly relatable) legends can be when the time machine is well-oiled.\n\nThere’s something odd and fascinating in hearing Napoleon justify his calculated risks or Cleopatra framing power as pure theater; it’s a reminder that the most storied figures had deeply human motives—ambition, doubt, the urge to leave a mark. Even as we zip from ancient Rome to Victorian science, the questions of leadership, adaptation, and philosophy remain (so much closer to our own than we assume).\n\nIf you’re even mildly history-curious, or have ever wondered how it would feel to pull up a chair next to greatness, give the trailer a quick listen. Would love to share this side project with you—one conversation at a time.",
  "x": "Echoes Through Time has a trailer. Leo, our very unofficial time-tour guide, is chatting with not-so-average folks: Napoleon on risk, Cleopatra on theater, Darwin on survival. (Turns out, the past is stranger—and more familiar—than expected.)\n\nIf you’ve got a minute and even a flicker of curiosity, come time-travel with us. Link in bio."
