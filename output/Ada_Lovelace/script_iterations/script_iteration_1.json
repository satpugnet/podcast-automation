  "description": "Step inside Victorian London with Leo, the time-traveling graduate student, for a vibrant, revelatory conversation with Ada Lovelace. Together they weave through her extraordinary life—her wild inventions as a precocious girl, the constraints and passions of society, a groundbreaking partnership with Charles Babbage, the writing of the world’s first program, mathematical scandal and victory, and how her legacy became the thread between poetry, machines, and the possibility of artificial intelligence.

Tonight on Echoes Through Time, join us as we slip into velvet darkness and the fragrance of beeswax, to listen and learn from none other than Ada Lovelace: the Enchantress of Number, poet’s daughter, scientific visionary—and the person who first dared to dream computers might compose music, art, and whole worlds of thought. Settle in. Her story is stranger, richer, and far more relevant than you might ever imagine."

Passing the white stone columns and the stern-faced butler, we enter Ada’s sanctuary: books from floor to ceiling, half-finished sketches of machines and bird bones on the desk, a faint chemical tinge from her experiment in the corner, and the warmth of amber candlelight.
