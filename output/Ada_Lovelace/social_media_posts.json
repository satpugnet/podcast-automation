  "linkedin": "New episode out: “Ada Lovelace – Imagination and Algorithms: How the First Computer Programmer Dreamed the Future.”\n\nPicture Victorian London: Ada Lovelace, daughter of Lord Byron, blends poetic flair and mathematical tenacity. She didn’t just help Babbage envision the Analytical Engine—she authored the world’s first published algorithm (by candlelight, for a machine that only existed in her mind). Ada predicted computers could create—music, art, whole worlds of logic—well before such ideas were fashionable, dancing between “poetical science” and mechanical precision. Her life was a tangle of brilliance, constraint, scandal, and audacity, shaping not only code, but how we think about technology’s potential. (I found myself wishing we debated AI with her kind of curiosity and discipline).\n\nIf the boundary between logic and imagination intrigues you, you might enjoy wandering through Ada’s library with us. I’d love to know what you take away from her story.",
  "x": "New episode: Ada Lovelace—Imagination & Algorithms is out. Victorian London, strict tutors, flying machines, and the first computer program—all woven by the daughter of a poet.\n\nTake a candlelit detour into Ada’s world and see how code started as poetry (at least in her hands)."
